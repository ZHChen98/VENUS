A polymorphic 9-bp deletion in exon 1 of TGFBR1 (TGFBR1*6A) has been identified as a low-penetrance cancer susceptibility allele. The strongest association in the initial studies was with breast cancer; however, these studies included patients with different types of cancer, including colon, cervical and breast carcinomas, with only a small proportion being breast cancer patients. In subsequent case-control studies focussing on breast cancer alone, the results have been equivocal. In order to clarify whether TGFBR1*6A is associated with breast cancer risk, we have genotyped this polymorphism in 988 breast cancer cases and 1,016 controls from the West of Ireland and also performed a meta-analysis of previously published data (5,150 cases and 6,344 controls). In our series from the West of Ireland, we found no association (genotypic odds ratio (OR) under a dominant model = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.731.19, P = 0.57; allelic OR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.74-1.15, P = 0.49). Meta-analysis showed evidence of heterogeneity among studies. Using the random effects model, it was found that there was no evidence of an association of the *6A allele with breast cancer (genotypic OR under a dominant model = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.94-1.28, P = 0.24, allelic OR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.97-1.31, P = 0.13). In conclusion, our study shows that there is no association between TGFBR1*6A and breast cancer risk.

Transforming growth factor beta receptor type I (TGFBR1) is a serine–threonine protein kinase, which mediates the growth-inhibitory signals from TGFB1 through a complex with TGFBR2. TGFBR1 contains a common polymorphism in exon 1 resulting in a deletion of three alanines from a stretch of nine alanines (TGFBR1*6A) . This 9-bp deletion is located within the predicted signal sequence cleavage region. Functional studies have suggested that TGFBR1*6A does not respond as well as the longer TGFBR1*9A allele to the growth inhibitory signals of TGFB1 . Several small studies have found that individuals who carry a TGFBR1*6A allele are at increased risk of cancer . A meta-analysis of seven published studies showed that carrying at least one copy of the TGFBR1*6A allele increased the risk of cancer overall colon, cervix, breast, ovarian and haematological cancers with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–1.49, and in particular, increased the risk of breast cancer (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.11–1.96) . A further meta-analysis was then performed, which included an additional three unpublished studies and again TGFBR1*6A was found to be a tumour susceptibility allele, increasing the risk of breast, ovarian and colorectal cancer (all cancers—OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10–1.40; breast cancer—OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.14–1.67) . This second meta-analysis included 7,850 individuals, of whom 1,420 were breast cancer cases. However, one of the problems with the studies in these meta-analyses was their individually small size, the mean number of cases per study being 248 (range 48–611). In 2007, Cox et al. genotyped the TGFBR1*6A/9A polymorphism in the largest cohort of breast cancer cases studied to date (1,187 cases, 1,673 controls) and found no association (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.76–1.17). A meta-analysis including this data and previously published data also showed no association (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.89–1.38). Subsequently, a Swedish group analysed their cohort of breast cancer cases (763 cases, 852 controls) and although they found no overall association, they did find a weak association with low-risk familial breast cancer and poorly differentiated breast cancer.
Since the association between the TGFBR1*6A and breast cancer remains uncertain, we genotyped the 6A/9A alleles in 988 breast cancer cases and 1,016 controls from the West of Ireland. We then performed a meta-analysis with all previously published data, in order to clarify whether there is any association between TGFBR1*6A and breast cancer risk.
About 988 breast cancer cases and 1,016 controls from the West of Ireland were collected with appropriate ethical approval, as part of the Breast cancer In Galway Genetics Study (BIGGS). This population has been subjected to few demographic movements and is consequently relatively homogenous, reducing allelic and genotypic heterogeneity. The mean age of the cases at diagnosis was 53 years (range 24–90 years). They were not selected with regard to family history of breast or ovarian cancer, personal history of ovarian cancer, the presence of a contralateral breast cancer or other second primary cancer. About 122 patients had a first degree relative with breast cancer (mean age 53.5 years), 153 patients had a second degree relative with breast cancer (mean age 50.5 years) and 40 patients had bilateral breast cancer (mean age 53.5 years). All controls were from a West of Ireland lineage (as were cases) and comprised women over the age of 60 years, with no self-reported personal history of any cancer and no reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer.
The power of our study was 80% at alpha 0.05 to detect a genotypic OR of 1.38 (which is the level of association previously described ).
DNA was extracted from blood using the Chemagic Magnetic Separation Module (Chemagen, Baesweiler, Germany) using the manufacturer’s reagents. The TGFBR1*6A polymorphism was amplified using the following primers: forward GAGGCGAGGTTTGCTGGGGTGAGG, reverse CATGTTTGAGAAAGAGCAGGAGCG. PCR products were analysed using the Genotyper programme (Applied Biosystems, CA).
Deviation of genotype frequencies from those expected under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was assessed by v2 test. The risk associated with TGFBR1*6A was estimated by unconditional logistic regression to give ORs under allelic, dominant and recessive models, with their associated 95% CIs.
For the meta-analysis, we undertook a Pubmed search using the following criteria: ‘‘TGFBR1 AND breast’’; ‘‘transforming growth factor beta receptor AND breast’’. Studies were included in the analysis, if genotype frequencies were reported and controls were in HWE (P  0.05), irrespective of sample size. Data were combined using the Mantel–Haenszel method. The data from identified studies were combined with our West of Ireland cohort to derive an overall estimate of breast cancer risk using fixed and random effects models. Cochran’s Q statistic to test for heterogeneity and I2 statistic to quantify the proportion of the total variation due to heterogeneity were calculated. All statistical analyses were undertaken using STATA 9.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Genotypes were obtained from 96% of samples and frequencies did not deviate significantly from HWE (v2 = 0.14, P = 0.9; Table 1). There was no evidence of an association between TGFBR1*6A and breast cancer under any of the tests used (Table 1); for example the OR for the allelic test of association was 0.93 (95% CI 0.74–1.15, P = 0.49). The OR for the TGFBR1*6A homozygote was 0.76 (95% CI 0.33–1.75, P = 0.53) and that for the 9A/9A TGFBR1*6A heterozygote was 0.93 (95% CI 0.73–1.19, P = 0.57) (Table 1). We had obtained clinico-pathological data (grade, ER status, Her2 status and family history) on 795 of our cases, as described previously , but there was no evidence of an association between TGFBR1 genotype and any of these variables (v2 test, P  0.2 in all cases).
We then undertook a meta-analysis combining data from the current study and previously published studies on breast cancer and TGFBR1*6A/9A. We identified 11 other studies that had typed the polymorphism in breast cancer cases (Table 2). All controls in these studies were in HWE and 0.2
0.5 1 2 odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 9A/6A all studies reported the genotype frequencies required for the dominant model combined OR comprising a total of 5,150 cases and 6,344 controls. For the combined allelic OR and the recessive model, only studies with data on allele frequency could be included. This resulted in the exclusion of one study, a negative study by Feigelson et al. (481 cases and 484 controls) , leaving 11 studies (including the current study) comprising a total of 4,669 cases and 5,860 controls (Table 2). Meta-analysis was performed using both fixed and random effects models. Under neither model was there any evidence of an 6A/6A 13 10 19 1 association between TGFBR1*6A and breast cancer. There was also, however, heterogeneity between studies heterogeneity v2 = 22.08 (df11), P = 0.02; I2 = 50%, and therefore the random effects model is reported here in detail. Using a dominant model, the overall genotypic OR was 1.10 (95% CI 0.94–1.28, P = 0.24; Fig. 1), and using a recessive model genotypic pooled OR was 1.15 (95% CI 0.77–1.73, P = 0.49). The combined allelic OR was 1.12 (95% CI 0.97–1.31, P = 0.13; Fig. 2).
TGFBR1*6A has been suggested as a general cancer susceptibility allele and associations with breast, colon, cervical, ovarian and haematological cancers have been demonstrated in small case–control studies . A meta-analysis of all these studies had shown an overall association with cancer for the five cancer types tested (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10–1.40 .) One of the strongest associations was with breast cancer (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.14–1.67) and on the basis of this and other studies, it has been estimated that TGFBR1*6A accounts for up to 5% of all breast cancer cases . One of the problems with these studies is their small size. Our study and the study by Cox et al. are the two largest case–control studies to look for an association between TGFBR1*6A and breast cancer, and both showed no evidence of an association. Metaanalysis by Cox et al. showed no overall association, and we confirmed these results in our own meta-analysis, which contains an additional 1,723 cases and 1,800 controls (total 5,150 cases and 6,344 controls).
Both our meta-analysis and that by Cox et al. showed considerable heterogeneity; no measures of heterogeneity were reported in the meta-analysis by Pasche et al. . The
Bias assessment plot Sample size 3000 2000 1000 0 -0.50 -0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 Log(Odds ratio) cause of this heterogeneity may be related to sample size and Fig. 3 shows that the studies with sample sizes \1,000 had the most extreme ORs. Another cause of heterogeneity may be due to selection of cases and controls, and ethnicity (Table 3).
The three studies (Table 3) that selected patients on the basis of family history, young age or bilaterality showed a trend towards a positive association, although only the study by Baxter et al. (355 cases) reached significance. However, subgroup analysis of the study by Song et al. did show a borderline significant association in patients with ‘low-risk familial’ breast cancer (one first degree relative or second degree relative).

The two studies that selected only post-menopausal women with breast cancer were negative, suggesting that the association may only be present in younger cohorts enriched for genetic predisposition. We applied the same selection criteria used by Baxter et al. (age \40 or bilateral cancers or a family history of breast cancer) to our study and identified 329 such cases. However, we found no association with TGFBR1*6A in this subgroup (allelic OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61–1.14, P = 0.25) which is of similar size to that studied by Baxter et al. (355 cases).
In studies where cases were unselected, the studies showing a trend towards a positive association were from the USA and predominantly Caucasian cohorts . Only the largest of these three studies (611 cases ) was statistically significant. Two of these studies were from the same centre, and controls were drawn from people who had attended for a non-cancer prenatal diagnosis. In both studies, the mean age of the controls was significantly younger than the cases. In the study by Kaklamani et al. , 50% of controls were \40 years of age, whereas only 14% of cases were under 40. There was also a significant difference in ethnicity between cases and controls—Hispanics made up 11.6% of the controls compared with 4.1% cases. These differences in control selection may account for some of the heterogeneity in the studies. The third study showing a trend towards a positive association in unselected patients was by Chen et al. . In this small study of 104 cases, cases and controls were selected from a tissue bank and genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from ‘normal’ paraffin embedded tissue, rather than DNA extracted from peripheral blood samples as in other studies. It is likely that a combination of these factors including differences in genotyping techniques has resulted in some false positive studies.
In conclusion, our study confirms that TGFBR1*6A is not associated with breast cancer and highlights the problems associated with small case–control studies, especially where minor allele frequencies are low. It remains to be seen whether the association with other cancer types, including colorectal cancer, can be validated in large case– control series.
