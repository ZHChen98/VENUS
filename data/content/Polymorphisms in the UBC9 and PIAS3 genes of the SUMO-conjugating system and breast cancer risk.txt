SUMOylation consists in the covalent conjugation of small ubiquitin-related modifiers to target proteins. SUMOylation participates in processes that are tightly linked to tumorigenesis, and genetic variability in the SUMO-conjugating system may influence the development of breast cancer. We recently reported that variation in the UBC9 gene encoding the SUMO-conjugating enzyme may affect the grade of breast tumors. Following comprehensive in silico analyses for detection of putative functional polymorphisms in 14 genes of the SUMO system, we selected one coding SNP in PIAS3 and seven tag SNPs in UBC9 for association analyses. Results were based on 1,021 cases, and 1,015 matched controls from the population-based GENICA study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. To explore the association with polymorphisms closely linked to the genotyped variants, multiple imputation based on HapMap data was applied. The study revealed associations of four UBC9 polymorphisms with risk of grade 1 tumors. Comparison of genotype and haplotype models indicated that the best representation of risk solely relied on rs7187167 under dominant penetrance. Women carrying the rare allele showed an increased risk of grade 1 tumors compared with common homozygotes (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.18-2.95). This effect appeared to be stronger in women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Imputation of polymorphisms in a 300-kb region around the genotyped polymorphisms identified no variants with stronger associations. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in UBC9 may affect the risk of grade 1 breast tumors.
SUMOylation is an essential cellular process, which consists in the covalent conjugation of small ubiquitin-related modifiers (SUMO-1, 2 and 3) to target proteins . This kind of posttranslational modification can change and regulate the function of a protein by governing protein– protein and protein–DNA interactions. Thereby, SUMO can change the localization, activity or stability of its substrates. SUMOylation is a multistep process involving three classes of enzymes called E1, E2 and E3 . First, mature SUMO is activated by a SUMO-activating enzyme complex composed of the E1 proteins AOS1 and UBA2. Next, SUMO is transferred from the E1 heterodimer to the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (UBE2I), which represents the only E2 component of the SUMO system. Finally, UBC9 transfers SUMO to a lysine residue of the substrate resulting in isopeptide bond formation. This last step is facilitated by E3 SUMO ligases such as the protein inhibitors of activated STAT (PIAS) family proteins that confer substrate specificity . Due to the existence of SUMO-deconjugating enzymes, called sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs), SUMOylation is a reversible and highly dynamic process. This class of enzymes also catalyses the proteolytic maturation of the SUMO precursor.
SUMO controls multiple events including transcription, nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and mitotic chromosome segregation . Further, it plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of genome integrity by regulating DNA replication, repair and recombination .
There is increasing evidence that SUMO is involved in tumorigenesis. Many tumor suppressors and oncoproteins, such as PML, WRN, BLM, c-JUN, c-FOS, TP53 and MDM2, are targets of SUMO . In a mouse xenograft model using breast cancer cells, it was shown that increased activity of UBC9 promotes tumor growth and low activity decelerates it . Moreover, several studies have described an up-regulation of enzymes involved in SUMO conjugation or deconjugation in a variety of malignancies . In breast cancer specimens, a higher expression of UBC9 and PIAS3 has been reported. In addition, SUMO regulates the activity of several nuclear hormone receptors including estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor , which play a central role in the development of hormone-driven breast tumors . SUMOylation of ERa is stimulated by PIAS1 and PIAS3 in a ligand-dependent manner and increases the transcriptional activity of the receptor . SUMO is also conjugated to co-regulators of ERa, thereby modulating their ability to interact with the nuclear receptor and to activate transcription .
Recently, we showed that genetic variation in UBC9 is associated with the histological grade of breast tumors and is a useful marker for breast cancer prognosis . Due to the close connection of SUMO with tumorigenesis, it is conceivable that genetic variability in genes of the SUMOconjugating system also affects breast cancer susceptibility. The present study addresses this hypothesis. Based on comprehensive in silico analyses for detection of putative functional polymorphisms in 14 genes of the SUMO-conjugating system (AOS1, UBA2, UBC9, PIAS1, PIAS2, PIAS3, PIAS4, SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, SENP5, SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3), we selected a coding polymorphism in PIAS3 and seven tag SNPs in UBC9 for association analyses. Associations with overall breast cancer risk and risks by tumor subtypes were assessed in 1,021 breast cancer cases and 1,015 population-based controls from the German GENICA study.
The GENICA study participants of the population-based breast cancer case–control study from the Greater Bonn Region, Germany, were recruited between 08/2000 and 09/ 2004 as previously described . In brief, 1,143 incident breast cancer cases and 1,155 population controls, matched in 5-year classes, participated in the study. The GENICA study was approved by the Ethic’s Committee of the University of Bonn, and all study participants gave written informed consent. Cases and controls were eligible if they were of Caucasian ethnicity, current residents of the study region and below 80 years of age. Among the recruited individuals, DNA samples were available for 1,021 (89%) breast cancer cases and 1,015 (88%) controls. Information on known and potential risk factors was collected for all participants via in-person interviews. The response rate was 88% for cases and 67% for controls. Characteristics of the study population regarding potential breast cancer risk factors included age at diagnosis, menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal), family history of at least one first degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer (yes, no), use of oral contraceptives (OC) (never, 0 to \5, 5 to \10, C10 years), use of hormone therapy (HT) (never, 0 to \10, C10 years), body mass index (BMI) (\20, 20 to \25, 25 to \30, C30 kg/m2) and smoking status (never, former, current) (Table 1). Information on clinical and histopathological tumor characteristics was collected and included histology (ductal, lobular, ductolobular), histological grade (G1, G2, G3), tumor size (T1, T2, T3, T4), lymph node status (N0, N C 1), ER status (positive, negative), PR status (positive, negative) and HER2 status (positive, negative) (Table 2). Tumor grade was determined according to the Nottingham Criteria, which comprises formation of tubuli, nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic rate.
polymorphisms (SNPs) by in silico analyses To identify potential promoter regions, the upstream sequences of the AOS1, UBA2, UBC9, PIAS1, PIAS2, PIAS3, PIAS4, SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, SENP5, SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO3 genes were analyzed by the web tool Tumor parameter Cases n (%) PromoterSweep . The analyzed sequences encompassed the 3-kb upstream region of the transcription start site (TSS), the region between the TSS and the translation start and the 200 bp downstream region of the translation start. The latter DNA segment was included in the analyses to facilitate the automatic identification of orthologs. In case of more than one possible TSS, the most upstream TSS was used for defining the 3 kb upstream region. All sequence and TSS data were obtained from the database Ensembl (version 54). PromoterSweep employs a combination of algorithms including promoter database searches, profile matrix searches based on known transcription factor binding sites (TFBs) and de novo motif discovery by comparing orthologous promoter regions. The integration of different methods leads to an improved prediction accuracy compared to single method tools. Identified promoter motifs fulfilled three criteria: they (1) showed homology to a promoter region annotated in a promoter database, (2) fitted to a profile matrix of a transcription factor and (3) appeared to be conserved among orthologous promoter regions. Predicted TFBs were screened for polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of more than 1% in the CEU HapMap population of European ancestry . Also non-synonymous coding SNPs in all 14 genes were analyzed for their potential effect on protein function using the web tools Polyphen and Panther .
Genomic DNA was extracted from heparinized blood samples (PuregeneTM, Gentra Systems, Inc., Mineapolis, USA) .
Genotyping of UBC9 polymorphisms (rs7187167, rs11248866, rs909915, rs8052688, rs761059, rs760160 and rs8063) was performed by TaqMan allelic discrimination as previously described . Genotyping of the PIAS3 polymorphism (rs17354559) was performed by PCR-based restriction fragment length (RFLP) analysis using the forward primer 50-TGC ACC CAG CCT CAG ATT G-30 and the reverse primer 50-GGA TCT CAT CAC AAT CTG ATC AG-30 (mismatch is underlined), and the restriction enzyme Hpy188 III. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with 2.5 U Hpy188 III (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany), separated on a 3% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (Sigma–Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) and scored by UV visualization. Fragment sizes are 255 and 23 bp for the C allele and 278 bp for the G allele.
Overall call rates ranged from 96.4 to 99.7%. Concordance rates of 135 duplicate samples (6.6%) were equal or greater than 99%. The distribution of genotypes in the control group was consistent with Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium evaluated by Fisher’s exact test.
Our study had a 90% power to detect an OR of 1.34 (a = 0.05, two-sided test, dominant model, the lowest MAF of the seven investigated UBC9 SNPs was 11%). For PIAS3, the power was 80% to detect an OR of 1.75 given a MAF of 2% (a = 0.05, two-sided test, dominant model).
Associations between each SNP and breast cancer risk were analyzed by logistic regression conditional on age in 5-year groups using the software package R (version 2.0.1). Risks were adjusted for potential breast cancer risk factors, which included menopausal status, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, OC use, HT use, BMI and smoking status. P values of Wald tests for individual SNPs B0.05 were considered statistically significant. Genotype-specific risks were calculated as odds ratios (OR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Associations between genotypes and risk of breast cancer subtypes were explored upon stratification of cases by histological grade, tumor histology, tumor size, lymph node status, ER, PR and HER2 status. Subgroups of cases were compared to all controls. Only strata with a size greater than five were analyzed. Due to our previous results , we primarily aimed to investigate possible associations with the risk of tumors stratified by grade. Other stratified analyses were performed in the sense of an exploratory testing. Global probability values for associations between genotypes and grade 1 tumor risk were corrected for multiple comparisons by permutation of the case–control status of each individual (10,000 iterations) considering 32 associations (any, 1, 2 and 3 grades 9 8 SNPs).
To identify subgroups of women at risk, we further investigated possible interaction effects of each SNP and the epidemiological variables menopausal status, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, use of OC, use of HT, BMI and smoking.
Model selection for the association of risk of grade 1 breast tumors and combinations of SNPs in UBC9 The relationship between genotype and grade 1 tumor risk was investigated based on four different penetrance models for rs7187167 and the genetically linked SNPs rs11248866 and rs8052688 (recessive, dominant, additive and threegenotype model). In all models, information on epidemiological risk factors was included as covariates (menopausal status, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, use of OC, use of HT, BMI and smoking). The best model was selected based on likelihood ratio tests using a covariates-only model as reference. The linked SNP rs909915 was not considered in this analysis because the homozygous genotype of the rare allele was not represented in grade 1 tumor patients.
To analyze the possible effect of combinations of SNPs, we inferred haplotypes and haplogenotypes (diplotypes) using the haplo.em function in the R package haplo.stats . Since the investigated polymorphisms were in linkage disequilibrium, the inference of haplotypes should increase the statistical power in comparison with an evaluation of possible additive or multiplicative interactions. Single SNP models were compared with diplotype models based on likelihood ratio tests, trying to optimize the goodness of fit of the model (large likelihood) and keeping the model as simple as possible (few degrees of freedom). Epidemiological risk factors were included in any model. Model comparisons were limited to those haplogenotypes represented in both grade 1 tumor cases and controls.
and by exploiting existing catalogs of variation . We imputed genotypes based on HapMap data to investigate genetic associations at a finer grid of locations across the genome (detect possible associations with genetic variants that were not genotyped in our study). Imputation relied on inference of haplotypes by means of the expectation– maximization (EM) algorithm in the presence of partially missing data. In brief, missing alleles were excluded from the calculation of allele frequencies. In the E-step, frequencies of partially missing genotypes were updated looping through all possible genotypes. In the M-step, all existing haplotypes that have alleles identical to the nonmissing alleles of this haplotype were updated. The certainty of imputation of genotypes using HapMap data was evaluated by cross-validation, and it was represented by minus the logarithm of the probability value (Pval) for Cohen’s Kappa between the true and the imputed genotypes. Selection of variants for subsequent analysis of association relied on the visual inspection of recombination rates and imputation accuracies in the ±500-kb region around the genotyped SNPs. Uncertainty in the imputed genotypes was taken into account in the conditional ordinal logistic regression by bootstrapping from the multinomial distribution of the expected genotypes given the observed, directly genotyped variants (1,000 replicates). The P values referred to a three-genotype model.
Selection of SNPs in genes of the SUMO-conjugating system for association studies To identify variants in 14 genes of the SUMO-conjugating system that may influence the expression or function of the encoded proteins, we performed comprehensive in silico analyses using HapMap data . The genes searched for functional SNPs encode the E1 components AOS1 and UBA2, the E2 protein UBC9, the E3 PIAS family members PIAS1, the splice variants PIASxa and PIASxb, PIAS3 and PIASy, the SUMO-specific proteases SENP1, SENP2, SENP3 and SENP5 and the modifiers SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. The upstream sequences of these genes were analyzed by a novel in silico tool, which employs a combination of different methods to predict potential promoter regions and transcription factors binding to them. None of the currently known polymorphisms with a MAF of more than 1% in the European HapMap population was located in predicted transcription factor binding sites. Screening of these genes for non-synonymous coding polymorphisms revealed one SNP in PIAS3 (rs17354559, MAF = 0.02) resulting in an amino acid substitution of serine to cysteine at position 390 (Ensembl Protein ID ENSP00000376765) that was predicted to be of functional relevance.
For association analyses, we selected the putative functional SNP in PIAS3 and seven tag SNPs (rs7187167, rs11248866, rs909915, rs8052688, rs761059, rs760160 and rs8063) in the UBC9 gene and the region 10,000 base pairs upstream of its transcription start as previously described .
Associations of SNPs in UBC9 and PIAS3 with overall breast cancer risk and risk by tumor subtypes We analyzed the eight polymorphisms in the UBC9 and PIAS3 genes within the GENICA study population. No association with overall breast cancer risk was observed (Table 3, any-grade). Frequencies of UBC9 haplotypes encompassing SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (rs7187167, rs11248866, rs909915 and rs8052688) did not differ significantly between cases and controls (data not shown).
Stratification of cases by histological grade, tumor histology, tumor size, lymph node status, ER, PR and HER2 status revealed associations with tumor grade. Four SNPs in UBC9 were significantly associated with the risk of grade 1 breast tumors (rs7187167, global P = 0.01; rs11248866, global P = 0.04; rs8052688, global P = 0.05; rs8063, global P = 0.05) (Table 3).
Model selection for single SNPs based on likelihood ratio tests revealed that a dominant model for rs7187167 was the best representation of the association between UBC9 genotype and risk of grade 1 breast cancer (Supplementary Table 1). Since the four UBC9 SNPs rs7187167, rs11248866, rs909915 and rs8052688 are in linkage disequilibrium, we investigated whether the risk of grade 1 tumors was affected by combinations of SNPs rather than by single polymorphisms. The dominant model based on rs7187167 was augmented by additional polymorphisms, and likelihood ratio tests showed a non-significant improvement of the goodness of fit. Model comparisons were limited to haplogenotypes represented in both grade 1 tumor cases and controls.
Based on the dominant model and conditional logistic regression, women with the rare allele of UBC9 rs7187167 had a higher risk of grade 1 breast tumors than women homozygous for the common allele (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.18– 2.95). The effect was more pronounced when cases had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer (14 women affected by grade 1 tumors with a family history, OR 2.18, 95% CI 0.70–6.77), however, was statistically not significant.
To correct for multiple testing (any, 1, 2 and 3 grades 9 8 SNPs), permutation analysis was performed. After correction, associations between UBC9 polymorphisms and grade 1 breast cancer risk did not remain statistically significant. j aROad (95% .100 .095 .064 .100 .091 .081 .100 .009 .156 .100 .083 .081 .100 .088 .111 .100 .107 .092 .100 .087 .090 .100 c c .071 dyom ,nono b i e3 s ) .()556 .()401 .()42 .()419 .()461 .()120 .()796 .()176 .()28 .()739 .()239 .()21 .()372 .()434 .()193 .()673 .()295 .()32 .()537 .()382 .()81 .()968 .()32 .()00 .()32 ,reapy rrsseeg radG seaC n(% 518 114 12 119 311 34 226 50 8 120 68 6 012 119 53 819 83 9 125 180 32 267 9 0 9 tenh tiisc o g b o l e rm l a lu o l lobG Pav .620 .409 .802 .500 .102 .303 .502 .401 feoh iitaon ) s d aROjad )I(95C% .rf)(reeceen001 ...)(1–88170011 ...)(1–69550221 .rf)(reeceen001 ...)(1–78160011 ...)(1–09340101 .rf)(reeceen100 ...)(1–38170099 ...)(11–7688012 .rfr)(eeceen100 ...)(1–48130097 ...)(–165102097 .rfr)(eeecen010 ...)(–791330411 ...)(–881303810 .rfr)(eeecen010 ...)(–691280111 ...)(0–55131058 .rfr)(eeecen010 ...)(–281080409 ...)(–871290010 .rfr)(eeecen010 c c ...(–881500511 ,ittrseecacovpun rssecanodonbo l m e2 s ) .()519 .()396 .()86 .()381 .()469 .()150 .()788 .()196 .()16 .()712 .()265 .()23 .()307 .()522 .()170 .()670 .()302 .()27 .()525 .()394 .()82 .()943 .()57 .()00 .()57 freaoo ttrseau radG saeC n(% 192 222 84 312 262 48 144 011 9 593 741 31 461 972 19 863 661 51 892 172 45 295 32 0 32 ,rseu eb3 b n a c d la leu ac rg 6 3 .

4 9 C 1 T 1 G 0 T Imputation of untyped SNPs flanking the genotyped SNPs in UBC9 Multiple imputation based on HapMap data was applied to investigate if rs7187167 or untyped SNPs in its proximity were responsible for the association with grade 1 tumor risk. Visual inspection of recombination rates in a 500-kb region centered on the genotyped SNPs, together with the results on certainty of imputation, suggested the selection of a 300-kb region comprising 210 SNPs, which showed heterozygosity in HapMap (Supplementary Fig. 1). Conditional logistic regression based on genotyped and imputed SNPs indicated that rs7187167 shows the strongest association with risk of grade 1 breast cancer (Fig. 1a). rs7187167 showed no significant association with risk of grade 2, grade 3 and any-grade breast tumors (Fig. 1b–d).
risk by epidemiological parameters To identify subgroups of women at risk, we further investigated possible interaction effects of the genotyped polymorphisms and menopausal status, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, OC use, HT use, BMI and smoking status. No statistically significant interactions were found.
There is increasing evidence of a crucial role of SUMO modification in tumorigenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that variation in genes of the SUMO-conjugating system may affect the risk of breast cancer. In an initial step, we screened 14 genes involved in SUMO modification for putative functional polymorphisms in the promoter and coding regions by performing comprehensive in silico analyses. We obtained evidence for one functional polymorphism in the coding region of the SUMO ligase gene PIAS3. In addition, we selected seven tag SNPs covering the complete promoter and gene region of UBC9, which encodes a key enzyme of SUMOylation. All SNPs were analyzed for associations with breast cancer risk in the population-based case–control study GENICA. evaluated. Multiple imputation was based on HapMap data and the called SNPs rs7187167, rs11248866, rs909915 and rs8052688 (black circles). Association of rs909915 with grade 1 tumor risk could not be assessed because the homozygous genotype of the rare allele was not represented in grade 1 tumor patients
None of the investigated polymorphisms seemed to alter the overall risk of breast cancer. However, stratification of patients by tumor grade revealed that four SNPs in UBC9 (rs7187167, rs11248866, rs8052688 and rs8063) were associated with the risk of grade 1 tumors. The best association model included rs7187167 under dominant penetrance, and this model was not improved by inclusion of additional SNPs in linkage disequilibrium. Women carrying the rare allele of rs7187167 had a risk of grade 1 tumors 1.9 times higher than women homozygous for the common allele. The identification of three additional association signals in the region adds consistency to this finding. Individual variants are expected to show stronger effects in familial, genetically enriched cases . Although not significant, we found that carriers with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer had a 2.2 times increased risk of grade 1 tumors, thus further supporting the biological relevance of rs7187167 variation. Results from multiple imputation confirmed that rs7187167 showed the strongest association with the risk of grade 1 tumors. Thus, the identification of multiple associations in the region, the stronger effect for familial cases and the imputation results suggest a contribution of rs7187167 to the risk of grade 1 breast tumors.
Multiple imputation has been shown to facilitate the detection of causal variants that have not been directly genotyped in the study . We applied imputation techniques followed by conditional logistic regression to assess if rs7187167, or rather a linked SNP in its proximity, was responsible for the observed association. Imputation of genotypes relied on the assumption of similar patterns of genetic linkage in the GENICA population and in the public repository HapMap. In this study, none of the imputed SNPs in the investigated gene region showed a signal of association stronger than that of rs7187167. Although the causal variant is yet unidentified, the result suggests that rs7187167 or a closely linked SNP may be responsible for the observed association with risk of grade 1 breast tumors. The causal variant could be a rarer SNP close to rs7187167, which was not genotyped or imputed in our study.
As yet, functional studies on rs7187167 are lacking. The polymorphism is located 14.8-kb upstream of the UBC9 translation start and disrupts a potential binding site for the transcription factor SP1 . In consequence, the rare allele may result in a lower UBC9 expression. To date, however, data on UBC9 expression levels supporting this hypothesis are not available. One previous study using an in silico approach to predict putative genes on the short arm of chromosome 16 suggested an open reading frame encompassing rs7187167 . Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that this polymorphism influences the function of a yet unidentified protein.
Many tumor suppressors and oncoproteins have been identified as SUMO substrates emphasizing SUMO’s crucial role in processes that are tightly linked to cancerogenesis. Although SUMO modification seems to be highly regulated, both spatially and temporally, it is conceivable that expression levels of UBC9 influence the balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation and thus the function of target proteins. Several SUMO targets are involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and cell cycle control , such as c-JUN, c-FOS , p53 and ERa , providing a possible link between SUMOylation and tumor grade. Two recent studies have reported a link between decreased SUMO conjugation and reduced growth of tumor cells. The first study used a mouse xenograft model and breast cancer cells to show that decreased UBC9 activity slows down tumor growth in vivo . Yang and Paschen reported that blocking SUMO-2 and 3 conjugations altered the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation and resulted in reduced growth of neuroblastoma cells in vitro . Thus, the assumption of rs7187167 or a closely linked SNP attenuating the expression of UBC9 would be in line with its effect of favouring the development of slowly growing grade 1 tumors. Moreover, the increased risk of grade 1 tumors associated with the rare allele of rs7187167 is in agreement with our previous results of a higher frequency of this allele in patients with low grade tumors . It is important to underline that our previous and the present study differ with respect to study design, case-only and case–control study, respectively, and analyzed different events. For example, in the former study, we showed a higher frequency of the rare rs7187167 TT genotype (14.3%) in grade 1 cases compared to grade 2 (8.5%) and grade 3 (4.1%) cases. In the present study, we additionally reported genotype frequencies in healthy controls. The present findings indicate that women affected by grade 1 breast tumors showed a higher TT genotype frequency (14.9%) than grade 2 (8.6%) and grade 3 (4.2%) cases as well as unaffected controls (6.8%), which refers to an increased risk of grade 1 breast cancer among TT carriers.
In summary, in this study on genetic variation in the SUMO-conjugating system, we found associations between four UBC9 SNPs (rs7187167, rs11248866, rs8052688 and rs8063) and the risk of grade 1 breast tumors. The strongest association was observed for rs7187167, and the effect appeared to be stronger in familial cases. A model selection strategy and multiple imputation indicated that, among genotyped and closely linked variants analyzed in the International HapMap Project, rs7187167 showed the most significant contribution to risk. Our data suggest that UBC9 variation influences the risk of grade 1 breast tumors. Replication studies in independent populations should be carried out to confirm this result.
