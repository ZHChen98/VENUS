Growing laboratory and animal model evidence supports the potentially carcinogenic effects of some phthalates, chemicals used as plasticizers in a wide variety of consumer products, including cosmetics, medications, and vinyl flooring. However, prospective data on whether phthalates are associated with human breast cancer risk are lacking.
prospective cohort (N=419 invasive cases and 838 controls). Controls were matched 2:1 to cases on age, enrollment date, follow-up time, and WHI study group. We quantified thirteen phthalate metabolites and creatinine in two or three urine samples per participant over one to three years. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI) for breast cancer risk associated with each phthalate biomarker over up to 19 years of follow-up.
Overall, we did not observe statistically significant positive associations between phthalate th st biomarkers and breast cancer risk in multivariable analyses (e.g. 4 vs 1 quartile of diethylhexyl phthalate OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.17). Results were generally similar in analyses restricted to disease subtypes, to non-users of postmenopausal hormone therapy, stratified by body mass index, or to cases diagnosed within three, five, or ten years.

Phthalates are present in many consumer products, including vinyl flooring, cosmetics, and medical supplies, and exposure is ubiquitous in the United States. interact with the estrogen receptor (ER), raising concerns for a potential impact on breast cancer (BC) risk. For example, butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) increase proliferation of ER+

DEP also had estrogenic effects in MCF-7 cells and in female rats. However, anti-estrogenic effects of BBP also have been reported.

Three retrospective breast cancer case-control studies report mixed findings. One reported increased BC risk with DEHP and DEP metabolites, yet an inverse association with 10 monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP).
Another reported increased BC risk associated with a different 11 DEHP metabolite, yet no association with other phthalate biomarkers. The most recent study reported statistically non-significant inverse associations between phthalate metabolites and BC 12 risk. These prior studies are all subject to important limitations. Notably, the retrospective casecontrol study design is problematic because phthalate exposure may occur through contact with medical equipment during diagnosis and treatment. Further, because phthalates are rapidly 13 metabolized and excreted, a single urine specimen does not reflect longer-term/earlier phthalate exposure, which is of greatest relevance to cancer risk.
Prospective studies with repeated measurements of multiple phthalate biomarkers can provide critical data to address the important question of whether phthalates impact breast health. We conducted a nested case-control study of phthalate biomarkers and BC risk within the D U Women’s Health Initiative, including up to three replicate measurements of urinary phthalate biomarkers among 419 cases and 838 matched controls.
The WHI recruited 161,808 postmenopausal women age 50-79 from 40 clinical centers trials (CT; N=68,132) and an observational study (OS; N=93,676). Three WHI clinical sites (N=11,020) included a bone density substudy for all participants, and were the only sites that collected urine samples. Participants provided first morning void urine samples at the baseline clinic screening visit, and additional samples were provided at year 1 (AV1; CT only) and year 3 non-melanoma skin cancer, and who had > =2 urine samples available. A total of 168 (40.1%) cases and 336 (40.1% controls) had three urine samples available for analysis.
BC diagnoses were self-reported annually and subsequently adjudicated by trained physicians using medical records including pathology data. We included all adjudicated cases of primary invasive BC occurring among eligible women diagnosed after AV3 and during their WHI follow-up through 2013. Cases diagnosed prior to AV3 were excluded to ensure that urinary phthalate biomarker measurements reflected pre-diagnostic levels. Controls were selected using incidence density matching from among eligible participants who were not diagnosed with BC and were individually matched on enrollment date, length of follow-up, age / L U at enrollment (+/- 3 years), and WHI study component (CT/OS) in a 2:1 ratio to cases. If > 2 eligible controls existed as a potential match for a case, two were randomly selected. was approved by institutional review boards (IRB) at each clinical center, with additional IRB approval for this analysis from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The involvement of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratory in the analysis of samples did not constitute engagement in human subjects research.
Based on prior evidence of association with either phthalate exposure and/or BC, we included the following additional covariates, measured at WHI enrollment, as potential confounders: race/region, education level, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) index, 15 16 (HEI) score, total dietary energy intake, HT use at enrollment, age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, breastfeeding history, age at menopause, Gail score, diabetes, high cholesterol, were obtained from medical records during the adjudication process; ER /PR status was missing
WHI followed a standard urine collection, processing, and storage protocol. First morning void urine samples were collected at home and processed < 30 minutes upon clinic D / L U and shipped to McKesson Bioservices packed in dry ice via overnight FedEx then stored at 70°C.
Phthalate metabolites are quantified to ensure that measured concentrations relate to endogenous exposures. The CDC measured thirteen phthalate metabolites in urine samples carboxynonyl phthalate MCNP, mono-carboxyoctyl phthalate MCOP, mono-3carboxylpropyl phthalate MCPP, mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate MECPP, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate MEHHP, MEHP, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate MEOHP, monoethyl phthalate MEP, mono-hydroxybutyl phthalate MHBP, monohydroxyisobutyl phthalate MHiBP, and monoisobutyl phthalate MiBP). The glucuronidated phthalate monoester undergoes enzymatic deconjugation followed by on-line solid phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Samples were randomly distributed through the batches, with all replicates from cases and matched controls analyzed together. A blinded 10% quality control sample was included and used to estimate CVs: MBP 5.4%, MBzP 6.1%, MCNP 4.7%, MCOP 6.3%, MCPP 5.8%, MECPP 4.3%, MEHHP 5.4%, MEHP 19.5%, MEOHP 6.0%, MEP 3.1%, MHBP 9.0%, MHiBP 21.9%, MiBP 10.3%. Laboratory staff were masked to the identity, disease status, and demographic and risk factor characteristics of the samples. Creatinine was measured using a detection (LOD) for creatinine was 1 mg/dL and the CV was 2.5%.

We grouped phthalate biomarkers by their parent phthalate, by dividing the concentrations of each metabolite of a single parent by its molecular weight and then summing concentrations across metabolites: 18,19 log transformed to improve normality. We calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) using a one-way random effects model on the creatinine corrected values to characterize the within- and between-participant variability across replicate samples and Pearson correlation coefficients to evaluate correlations among the phthalate biomarker concentrations, using the individual replicate measures.
For further analyses, we averaged the creatinine-standardized phthalate biomarker concentrations across replicate measurements per participant, and used the arithmetic average values in analyses. Geometric means for each phthalate biomarker were compared between BC cases and controls and ER/PR status using the generalized linear models to appropriately account for the matched study design.
We fit conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to characterize associations between creatinine-standardized phthalate biomarkers and BC, both as continuous (natural log transformed) variables and categorized into quartiles according to the control distribution. We evaluated the aforementioned variables as confounders by first fitting a multivariable model including these potential confounders, and then testing the statistical significance of each covariate using likelihood ratio tests, retaining all covariates with a p value < 0.25, as a conservative approach given that a common set of covariates was to be identified for adjustment in separate models for each phthalate biomarker. D U assignment, and calcium and vitamin D trial assignment. Tests of linear trend were conducting by testing the significance of an ordinal variable coding for quartiles of phthalate biomarkers.
We repeated analyses stratifying by ER/PR status and BMI and testing for effect modification using likelihood ratio tests. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis evaluating the role of phthalate biomarker concentration on BC risk among women without HT repeated analyses restricting to cases diagnosed within 3 or 5 years of AV3 to evaluate short

phthalate-specific ICC to correct the calculated OR, using publicly available SAS macros. 23 These results were similar in direction of associations compared to our primary analysis without evaluated choosing a single measurement of phthalate biomarkers (i.e. baseline or AV3), and ORs and 95% CIs, based on average urinary phthalate biomarker concentrations standardized by creatinine. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Cases and controls were on average 62.56 (SD 6.93) and 62.46 (SD 6.86) years old, respectively (Table 1). Cases were more often obese, current smokers, and less physically active than controls, and Gail risk score was higher among cases. The majority of cases had ER+/PR+ disease (74.0%).
Geometric mean concentrations of phthalate biomarkers were similar between cases and controls (Table 2). ICCs were all ≤0.12. Metabolite concentrations from the same parent phthalate were highly correlated (e.g. MHiBP and MiBP, r=0.95), while others were moderately (e.g. MBzP and MHBP, r=0.74) or not correlated (Supplementary Table 1).
In general, phthalate biomarker concentrations were not associated with increased BC th st risk, either overall or by disease subtype (Table 3 and 4; e.g. 4 vs 1 quartile of ΣDEHP: OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.17). There was a suggestive inverse association between MBzP and overall th st BC (4 vs 1 quartile: OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52-1.09, p trend=0.03), which persisted among th st ER+/PR+ cases (4 vs 1 quartile: OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44-1.12, p trend=0.08). ΣDiBP th st concentrations exhibited an inverse association with BC risk (e.g. 4 vs 1 quartile of ΣDiBP: OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47-1.00, p trend=0.07).
We repeated analyses restricting to cases diagnosed within three (N=113 cases, N=215 th st BC within three years (4 vs 1 quartile: OR 9.96, 95% CI 1.93-51.27; p trend=0.07), which was th st not apparent within five years (4 vs 1 quartile: OR 1.88, 95% CI 0.82-4.29; p trend=0.79). In general, other associations were not statistically significant yet suggestive of increased risk within three years, although closer to the null within five years. D U were not statistically significantly associated with decreased risk. Results were consistent in analyses stratified on BMI category (Supplementary Table 5).
In this prospective study, we report no association between urinary phthalate biomarker concentrations and increased BC risk. There were suggestive inverse associations between MBzP concentrations and risk of invasive and ER+/PR+ disease and an inverse association lack of statistically significant associations between urinary phthalate biomarker concentrations persisted in analyses restricted to disease subtypes, non-users of HT, or cases diagnosed within three or five years of exposure assessment or when stratified on BMI.
Phthalate biomarker concentrations exhibited high within-person variability over a threeyear period, which is consistent with prior investigations 19,24-28 and suggests that a single urinary measurement of phthalate biomarkers insufficiently characterizes exposure over a three year period. We addressed this concern by incorporating up to three repeated measurements of phthalate biomarkers per participant. We explored various approaches to analyzing these data, including application of statistical measurement error correction methods. 20,21
D U M associated with phthalate exposure are unlikely, although smaller biological effects, if they exist, could have been missed due to measurement error.
Given the strong possibility that measurement error may have biased our results toward null findings, it is useful to consider the direction of effect estimates even if not statistically significant. For example, we observed statistically non-significant positive associations with HT use was very common in this study population, the numbers of non-HT users was very small for this analysis (89 cases and 114 controls) and therefore reduced statistical power also may have contributed to the lack of statistical significance despite some strong effect estimates (e.g.
th st 4 vs 1 quartile of MCOP, OR=4.21, 95% CI 0.96-18.54). Because phthalates are far less estrogenic than HT formulations, it is possible that HT use may mask any true effect of phthalate exposure on BC risk. It is thus noteworthy that we did observe some potential positive, yet not statistically significant, associations between phthalate biomarker concentrations and BC risk among this subgroup of women. Future studies with larger numbers of non-HT users will be informative in understanding whether phthalate exposure is associated with postmenopausal BC risk among women not using HT. Such studies are especially important given the recent population decline in postmenopausal HT use.

While not entirely consistent, we observed some positive effect estimates between phthalate biomarker concentrations and BCs diagnosed within three years of the last biomarker th measurement, some of which were statistically significant for ER+/PR+ disease (e.g. 4 vs 1 st quartile of ΣDBP: OR 9.96, 95% CI 1.93-51.27, p trend=0.07). Interestingly, effect estimates were closer to the null and not statistically significant when analyses were extended to include cases diagnosed within five years or among the full study population. However, these results / L U M useful for understanding whether phthalate biomarker concentrations predict short-term, but not long-term, BC risk.
Although we report the first prospective analysis of phthalate biomarker concentrations in relation to BC risk, a few retrospective studies have been conducted. Our observed inverse similar reports in case-control studies of Mexican association was observed among Alaskan Native women.
Many laboratory and animal studies 11 report estrogenic effects of BBP, 4,5,7,9,30-35

which support our findings.
9,36 and inverse associations with ΣDiBP/MiBP, consistent with prior studies. studies that measured MCPP, both reported inverse associations with BC risk supported by our observed null association. Likewise, we did not observe the inverse associations with MEP 10 and MEHP 11
have been reported, yet our study and others are not consistent with these findings. Differences in observed associations across studies may reflect differences in population exposure resulting in different phthalate biomarker distributions, differences in study design, the potential impact of recent exposure to phthalates via medical equipment and medications among cases, or random variation given the relatively low reproducibility of urinary concentrations of phthalate biomarkers.
This study must be considered in the context of some additional limitations. First, our participants were postmenopausal at the time of sample donation, and this timing may not be D U M increasingly appreciated. Some, studies observed associations between phthalate biomarkers and breast development and earlier puberty. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals may be important at critical periods earlier in life, such as during adolescence or prior to first pregnancy; however, we were unable to evaluate exposure at these time periods. Future studies taking a life course approach would be useful, and may identify associations that were not apparent given exposure assessed after menopause. Second, we performed numerous statistical tests and did not adjust for multiple comparisons, in order to avoid being overly conservative given the measurement error issues previously noted. It is possible, therefore, that the statistically significant associations we observed might reflect type I error. Finally, while our study population was multi-ethnic, the number of BC cases among racial/ethnic minority groups was insufficient to conduct stratified analyses.
Our results are strengthened by the prospective study design, which is a notable improvement over prior retrospective studies. Also, we utilized a large number of adjudicated, invasive BC cases and matched controls on factors including age at enrollment, enrollment date, and length of follow-up, which aided in adjusting for potential confounding in our analyses, along with the adjustments permitted by the extensive covariate data available through the WHI. Measured concentrations of urinary phthalate metabolites were generally similar to those 50 measured among the U.S. general population during the same time period. Importantly, we incorporated repeated measurements of a broad panel of phthalate metabolites, which allowed for better characterization of phthalate exposure than prior work. The ICC increases with the number of replicates (k) used according to the following equation: ICCadj= ICC/ICC + (1ICC)/k. Assuming an observed ICC of 0.10, six replicates would be required to achieve a D U M be useful for planning future epidemiologic studies of phthalates and other non-persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals.
In summary, our results suggest that phthalate biomarker concentrations are unlikely to phthalate biomarker concentrations exhibited suggestive associations with decreased BC risk, reported positive associations between phthalate biomarkers and conditions that may themselves affect breast cancer risk, including elevated BMI, 51,52 weight gain, 53
54 diabetes, and insulin 55 resistance; therefore, phthalate exposures could indirectly affect postmenopausal breast cancer risk. While our study is the most comprehensive and methodologically rigorous evaluation to date, we focused only on postmenopausal exposure to phthalates in relation to risk of postmenopausal BC. Given the continued ubiquity of these chemicals in consumer products, additional exploration of the potential impact of phthalate exposure at various periods during the life course in relation to later BC risk will be useful to fully understand the risk profile of these
