data on the effects of early exposure, before first birth, are needed.
Experimental data provide some evidence of a link between a number of carcinogens in air pollution and breast cancer, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can cause mammary tumors in laboratory animals(1). Epidemiological data are mixed, with case-control studies(2) detected association and cohort studies(3–5) found no association between air pollution and breast cancer incidence. The latest Canadian case-control study found a 26-32% increased risk of pre-menopausal, and 7-10% increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, per 10 ppb increase in nitrogen dioxide NO2(2). Three cohort studies did not detect association between breast cancer incidence and NO2(3), PM with diameter < 2.5 µg/m3 (PM2.5) or PM with diameter < 10 µg/m3 (PM10)(3,4), or nitrogen dioxide NOx(5). Only two studies had data on PM2.5 and PM10 (3,4). Here we examined the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 at the residence and incidence of breast cancer in the nationwide, prospective Danish Nurse Cohort (DNC).

and to the Danish Cancer Register for diagnosis of primary invasive breast cancer (ICD-10 code
baseline. We used the Danish integrated air pollution modelling system (THOR and AirGIS) to estimate human exposure to outdoor air pollution at address level(6). We estimated annual mean concentration of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 at the residential addresses for nurses with complete information on residential address history 80% of the time between 1990 and 2013, and used the three-year running mean of each pollutant concentrations as the main exposure proxy. We used the time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression to model association between breast cancer incidence and air pollution, with age as the underlying time scale, and stratified by year of birth, in three steps: age adjusted; adjusted additionally for smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI); and additionally adjusted for age at 1st birth, parity, age at menarche, hormone therapy (HT) and oral contraceptive (OC) use (described in Table 1). Effect modification by smoking status, BMI, menopausal status at baseline, HT use, and urbanization level was examined by including interaction terms in the model. Effects are reported by hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), per interquartile range increase in 3-year mean of pollutant levels. The methods for establishing the cohort(7) and some prior accomplishments related to studying health effect of air pollution (6,8) have been previously described.

cancer onset, which may not be the relevant exposure window for development of breast cancer. A study found significantly increased breast cancer risk with exposure to traffic emissions at first childbirth, but no risk associated with later exposure windows(9), in line with growing evidence of relevance of early smoking on breast cancer risk(10).
