SULT1A1 is involved in biotransformation of many endogenous and exogenous substrates, such as drugs, hormones and tobacco smoke carcinogens. A polymorphism in the sulfotransferase 1A1 gene (SULT1A1) results in an amino acid change from Arg to His at codon 213. The His213 allele (SULT1A1*2) has been shown to encode a protein with much lower catalytic activity than the protein encoded by the Arg213 allele (SULT1A1*1). We examined whether this polymorphism modified breast cancer risk in a FinnishCaucasian study population consisting of 483 breast cancer patients and 482 healthy population controls. No significant genotype effects were seen in the overall breast cancer risk. However, a decreased risk of breast cancer was found among premenopausal women with at least three pregnancies and at least one SULT1A1*2 allele (odds ratio = 0.23, 95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.63) compared to women with two SULT1A1*1 alleles. Our results suggest that the SULT1A1 genotype is not an important risk factor for breast cancer in general, but may modify
Soluble cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) are a superfamily consisting of at least 11 distinct proteins in humans. The SULTs are involved in the conjugation of the sulfo group to several carcinogens, hormones, drugs and xenobiotics. Sulfonation usually results in the formation of excretable products, but it may also lead to an increase in biological activity of some drugs and several procarcinogens .
To date, three SULT1A isoforms (i.e., SULT1A1, SULT1A2 and SULT1A3) have been found in humans.
The most common variant alleles of SULT1A1 and SULT1A2 (i.e., SULT1A1*2 and SULT1A2*2) have been shown to be in tight linkage disequilibrium in Caucasians, Chinese and African-Americans . In SULT1A1 gene a G > A base change, distinquishing the SULT1A1*2 allele from the wild-type SULT1A1*1 allele, results in an arginine to histidine substitution at codon 213. Functional assays in human platelets have shown that subjects with two SULT1A1*2 variant alleles exhibit remarkably lower activity and thermostability compared to subjects with at least one wild-type allele . The SULT1A3 isoform was recently found to be encoded by two different genes (i.e. SULT1A3 and SULT1A4), with the latter of these resulting from a duplication of the SULT1A3 gene . the risk among premenopausaul women with high parity.

This case–control study is an extension of the Kuopio Breast Cancer Study in which women with a suspect breast lump or breast symptoms and living in the study catchment area were referred to Kuopio University Hospital during the years 1990–95. The subjects were asked to participate in the study during their first hospital examination and were interviewed before their diagnosis was known. In total, 516 women were diagnosed with histologically confirmed breast cancer. Twelve women, who were finally confirmed as breast cancer cases, refused to participate in this study. Accordingly, the cooperation rate for cases was 98%.
The recruitment protocol missed 51 women who were private patients not entering the hospital through the standard procedure. Due to a nurses’ strike lasting for one month in spring 1995, an additional 11 cases were missed.
According to the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry only 26 breast cancer patients from the hospital catchment area were treated elsewhere. The contact rate for the cases was therefore 86% and the overall response rate 84%. Lymphocyte DNA was available for 486 cases; but, three of them were excluded because of the poor quality of DNA. The final case group therefore consisted of 483 subjects.
Controls drawn from the Finnish National Population Registry were healthy women with no previous breast symptoms or problems and living in the same study area as the cases. In total, 514 women were interviewed in parallel with the cases. The cooperation rate among controls was 72%. Lymphocyte DNA was available for 492 controls. Ten of them were excluded due to an earlier breast cancer diagnosis (n = 4), non-Finnish origin (n = 2) or poor quality of the DNA sample (n = 4). Thus, the final control population consisted of 482 controls.
One hundred ng of the DNA was used as template in the genotyping analyses using a polymerase chain-based method . For quality control, internal control samples with known genotypes, as well as negative controls, were included in each run. Additionally, a random repertoire of 10% of all samples were re-analysed with identical results.
All results were intepreted by two independent investigators. Genotype data were achieved for 480 cases and 478 controls.
Association between the SULT1A1 genotypes and breast cancer risk was examined by unconditional logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using SPSS 9.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Known or suspected risk factors for breast cancer were used as adjusting variables. Covariates included age ( < 45, 45–53, 53–61, > 61 years), age at menarche ( r 12, 13–14, Z 15 years), age at first full-term pregnancy (nulliparous, < 25, 25–30, > 30 years), number of full-term pregnancies (continuous), history of benign breast disease (no/yes) and first degree (mother, sister, daughter) family history of breast cancer (no/yes). Subjects were excluded from the logistic regression if any of the adjusting variables was missing.
Possible associations between the SULT1A1 genotypes and menopausal status, parity (0, 1–2, Z 3), body mass index (BMI) ( r 25.4 kg/m2, > 25.4 kg/m2), use of alcohol (never/ever), postmenopausal use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (never/ever), age at menarche ( r 12, 13–14, Z 15 years), age at first full time pregnancy ( < 25, 25–30, > 30 years), estrogen receptor (ER) status ( – / + ), and smoking history (never/ever and never active/passive, only passive, ex-smokers and current smokers) were examined by stratified analyses.
Women were considered postmenopausal if they had reported natural menopause or had gone through bilateral oophorectomy. In addition, women who were hysterectomized with intact ovaries/ovary (40 cases and 41 controls), as well as those for whom the details of the operations were unknown (six cases and two controls), were classified postmenopausal if they were no longer menstruating and were older than 51 years (median for menopause among Finnish women). The remainder were classified as premenopausal.
Based on the data from previous studies, women with the high sulfonation activity-related SULT1A1*1/*1 genotype were used as the reference category in all separate analyses .
The cases were approximately five years older (58.9 ± 14.3 years) than the controls (53.5 ± 10.9 years) (P < 0.001). In this study population, parity and use of oral contraceptives have previously been found to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk, whereas positive family history of breast cancer, history of benign breast disease and high waist-to-hip ratio ( > 0.91) were shown to increase the risk of breast cancer .
The SULT1A1 genotype frequencies in the control population conformed to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.12).
The frequency of the SULT1A1*2 allele (0.46) was somewhat higher than the frequencies previously observed in Caucasian populations (0.31–0.37) , but no significant overall association between the SULT1A1 genotypes and breast cancer risk was observed (Table 1), in agreement with three previous studies .
Neither did menopausal status modify the association in the present study (data not shown). By contrast, in one previous study, a borderline significant increased risk (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.0–3.2) of breast cancer was found for postmenopausal women with homozygous SULT1A1*2/*2 genotype . Moreover, the women with this genotype were at increased risk of breast cancer if they concurrently had been under prolonged exposure to endogenous estrogen (early menarche, late menopause, high BMI or regular use of alcohol) or if they had been consuming rare/medium meat . In a recent case-only study, the frequency of SULT1A1*2 alleles was also significantly higher (31.7%) among premenopausal women compared to postmenopausal women (22.1%) (P = 0.02) .
In our study, a decreased risk of breast cancer was found among premenopausal women having experienced at least three pregnancies and carrying the SULT1A1*2 allele (OR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.09–0.63) (Table 2). A significant trend (P for trend = 0.008) of decreasing risk with an

Moreover, a borderline significant interaction between number of children and SULT1A1 genotypes was found (P = 0.08) (Table 2). By contrast, among postmenopausal women, no significant associations between SULT1A1 genotype and breast cancer were seen when stratified by parity (data not shown). This disagrees with the findings of Zheng et al. , who observed an increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women with lower ( r 2) parity and homozygous SULT1A1*2/*2 genotype compared to women with SULT1A1*1/*1 genotype and the same amount of pregnancies (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.0–6.1). However, because their study population consisted solely of postmenopausal women, the possible interaction between SULT1A1 genotypes and number of children among premenopausal women could not be explored.
Furthermore, the study by Zheng et al. included women from Iowa (USA) whereas our study population consisted solely of subjects of Finnish Caucasian origin.
The Finnish population is known to be one of the beststudied genetic isolates, which originated from small founder population some 2000 years ago. Therefore, the Finnish population has a relatively homogenous gene pool .
Substantial amounts of endogenous estradiol metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2) have been suggested to be formed from 2-methoxyestrogens, which have been shown to reach higher levels during pregnancies compared to the menstrual cycle or postmenopausal stage . This metabolite has been reported to have potential anti-proliferative, anti-tumourigenic and anti-angiogenic effects in breast carcinogenesis . Because SULT1A1 has been shown to be involved in the sulfonation of 2-MeOE2 in breast cancer cell lines, it can be hypothesized to modify the effects of this compound . For example, the potential protective effect caused by 2-MeOE2 could be prolonged due to the higher levels of its unconjugated form in women with high-parity and low sulfonation activity compared to women with high-parity and high sulfonation activity.
However, this idea remains speculative. Because the results were based on a very small subgroup of premenopausal women with high parity (50 breast cancer cases and 57 controls), the findings should also be regarded as preliminary. Due to the multiple comparisons performed, the possibility of a chance finding should also be considered.
In a previous case-only study, an increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer was observed in women smokers with at least one SULT1A1*2 allele . By contrast, no association between the SULT1A1 genotypes and the level of PAH-DNA adducts in breast tissue was seen in another study . In our study, the smoking habits had no effect in the association between SULT1A1 genotypes and breast cancer risk (data not shown). Nor was any modifying role in susceptibility to this malignancy found for the age at menarche, age at first full-term pregnancy, BMI, use of alcohol, postmenopausal use of HRT, or ER status (data not shown). We were unable to explore the effect of diet (rare/medium meat) because the data on dietary factors were unavailable.
In conclusion, although the SULT1A1*2 alleles do not appear to have a significant overall effect on breast cancer risk in Finnish women, they may exhibit protective effect against this malignancy among premenopausal women with high parity. However, these findings can only be considered as preliminary until they are verified in future studies with a larger sample size.
