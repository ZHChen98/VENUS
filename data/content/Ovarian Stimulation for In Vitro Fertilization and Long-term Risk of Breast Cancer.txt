IMPORTANCE Previous studies of breast cancer risk after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment were inconclusive due to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE To assess long-term risk of breast cancer after ovarian stimulation for IVF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Historical cohort (OMEGA study) with complete follow-up through December 2013 for 96% of the cohort. The cohort included 19 158 women who started IVF treatment between 1983 and 1995 (IVF group) and 5950 women starting other fertility treatments between 1980 and 1995 (non-IVF group) from all 12 IVF clinics in the Netherlands. The median age at end of follow-up was 53.8 years for the IVF group and 55.3 years for the non-IVF group. EXPOSURES Information on ovarian stimulation for IVF, other fertility treatments, and potential confounders was collected from medical records and through mailed questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of invasive and in situ breast cancers in women who underwent fertility treatments was obtained through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry (1989-2013). Breast cancer risk in the IVF group was compared with risks in the general population (standardized incidence ratios SIRs) and the non-IVF group (hazard ratios HRs). RESULTS Among 25 108 women (mean age at baseline, 32.8 years; mean number of IVF cycles, 3.6), 839 cases of invasive breast cancer and 109 cases of in situ breast cancer occurred after a median follow-up of 21.1 years. Breast cancer risk in IVF-treated women was not significantly different from that in the general population (SIR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.93-1.09) and from the risk in the non-IVF group (HR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.86-1.19). The cumulative incidences of breast cancer at age 55 were 3.0% for the IVF group and 2.9% for the non-IVF group (P = .85). The SIR did not increase with longer time since treatment ( 20 years) in the IVF group (0.92 95% CI, 0.73-1.15) or in the non-IVF group (1.03 95% CI, 0.82-1.29). Risk was significantly lower for those who underwent 7 or more IVF cycles (HR, 0.55 95% CI, 0.39-0.77) vs 1 to 2 IVF cycles and after poor response to the first IVF cycle (HR, 0.77 95% CI, 0.61-0.96 for < 4 vs 4 collected oocytes). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women undergoing fertility treatment in the Netherlands between 1980 and 1995, IVF treatment compared with non-IVF treatment was not associated with increased risk of breast cancer after a median follow-up of 21 years. Breast cancer risk among IVF-treated women was also not significantly different from that in the general population. These findings are consistent with absence of a significant increase in long-term risk of breast cancer among IVF-treated women.
jamanetworkcme.com F lignancy among women worldwide.1 Both exogenous or decades, breast cancer has been the most common maand endogenous estrogens and progestogens have been shown to affect breast cancer risk.2-4 Since in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures temporarily cause decreased estradiol and progesterone levels (during down-regulation of the natural cycle),5 as well as strongly elevated levels6 (during stimulation phase), IVF might influence breast cancer risk.
Knowledge about possible long-term influences of ovarian stimulation for IVF on breast cancer risk is still scarce because use of IVF did not become widespread until the late 1980s.7,8 A meta-analysis reported inconclusive results regarding the effect of ovarian DCIS ductal carcinoma in situ stimulation for IVF on FSH follicle-stimulating hormone breast cancer risk,9 but hCG human chorionic gonadotropin most studies had a relahMG human menopausal tively short follow-up and gonadotropin lacked subfertile compariIUI intrauterine insemination son groups. Because of the IVF in vitro fertilization high incidence of breast cancer and the large numbers of women undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF, even a small risk increase would have important public health implications. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quantify the long-term risk of breast cancer in a nationwide cohort of women treated with ovarian stimulation for IVF or other fertility treatments. A secondary aim was to examine the separate associations of subfertility diagnosis and of IVF treatment components with breast cancer risk.
In 1995 and 1996, a historical cohort (OMEGA study) of women treated for subfertility was identified, comprising women who started ovarian stimulation for IVF between 1983 and 1995 in one of the 12 IVF clinics in the Netherlands (IVF group) and a comparison group of women who started fertility treatments other than IVF between 1980 and 1995 in 4 clinics (non-IVF group). Most women in the non-IVF group underwent tubal surgery, (low-dose ovarian stimulation) intrauterine insemination (IUI), hormonal treatments (eg, clomiphene), or withdrew from the waiting list for IVF. Women in the non-IVF group were included with similar subfertility diagnoses as women in the IVF group. The institutional ethical committee of each of the IVF clinics approved the study procedures, which have been previously described.10-12
Between 1997 and 2000, eligible women were invited to complete a risk factor questionnaire and to provide written informed consent for medical record data abstraction and future linkage with disease registries. The questionnaire ascertained each participantâ€™s reproductive history, fertility treatments, use of exogenous hormones, lifestyle factors, and family history of cancer. Trained abstractors registered subfertility diagnoses, fertility-improving surgical procedures, and, for each IVF or IUI cycle, date, dosage, and type of fertility drugs, number of oocytes collected, and outcomes from medical records. In 2012, information on treatment cycles that women received after data collection in the period between 1997 and 2000 was added from electronically available data from all 12 IVF clinics. For approximately 23% of the cohort, subfertility diagnosis and number of IVF cycles were obtained from questionnaire data because data from medical records were not available. Both participating and nonresponding women were linked with the Dutch Municipal Personal Records Database, yielding information on vital status, parity, and age at first birth for 99% of the cohort through August 2013.
For 95.7% of the cohort, cancer incidence in the period 1989 through December 2013 was ascertained from the populationbased Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR)12,13 because 4.3% of women declined linkage. For cases of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), date of diagnosis and histology were obtained.
Because the Netherlands Cancer Registry did not fully cover the Netherlands before 1989, observation time for each participant started on January 1989, the date of first IVF treatment (IVF group), or the date of the first clinic visit for subfertility evaluation (non-IVF group), whichever came last. Person-years of observation were calculated through December 31, 2013, date of any cancer diagnosis, or date of death, whichever came first. Women originally included in the nonIVF group, who subsequently received IVF, contributed persontime to the non-IVF group until the date of first IVF treatment, then switched to the exposed group from this date (according to standard cohort methodology regarding timedependent allocation of person-years in case of changing exposure).14 Women with a cancer diagnosis before 1989 or cohort entry were excluded.
First invasive and in situ breast cancer incidence in the IVF group and the non-IVF group was compared with incidence among women in the Dutch population. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as the ratios of observed and expected numbers in the cohort. Expected numbers of breast cancer cases were calculated by multiplying sex-, 5-year age-, and 3-year calendar-specific population incidence rates from the Netherlands Cancer Registry with the corresponding number of person-years observed among cohort members.15 Breast cancer incidence rates per 100 000 women were calculated for the IVF group and the non-IVF group by dividing the number of observed incident breast cancers by the number of person-years 301 multiplied by 100 000. For the general population, breast cancer incidence rates per 100 000 women were calculated by dividing the observed numbers by the number of person-years, divided by 100 000, and multiplied by the observed:expected ratio in the full cohort.
Cumulative incidences of breast cancer at age 55 years were calculated for the IVF group and the non-IVF group using the life-table method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare breast cancer risk between the IVF and the non-IVF groups, adjusting for confounders. Hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer and 95% CIs were calculated with cumulative numbers of IVF cycles and births as timedependent variables, using age (in years) as time scale. All other variables were included as fixed variables. None of the variables violated the proportional hazards assumption when evaluating log-minus-log plots. Confounders were defined as factors changing the risk estimate for the exposure of interest by 10% or more in a model including the potential confounder(s) and the variable of interest. Confounders were tested in models restricted to women who responded to the questionnaire since information on a number of potential confounders was missing for nonresponders. Selected confounders were subsequently included in all analyses including both responders and nonresponders.
Dose-response associations were examined with total number of IVF cycles, number of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) ampules, and numbers of oocytes collected. Since women in the IVF group and the non-IVF group could have been treated with mild ovarian stimulation necessary for IUI, dose-response associations including the total number of IUI and IVF cycles were also investigated. Furthermore, the IVF group was also compared with a reference group of women who did not receive IVF, IUI, clomiphene, or any other fertility drug during the observation period. Effect modification of the association between IVF treatment and breast cancer risk by other breast cancer risk factors, especially parity, was examined. In all main analyses, missing values were included as a separate category. Four sensitivity analyses were performed: ( ) with invasive breast cancer and DCIS as a combined outcome variable (75% of the cohort was â‰¥50 years at end of follow-up, the age at which population screening in the Netherlands starts); ( ) in the cohort restricted to women who started fertility treatment from 1989 onward; ( ) with multiple imputation for missing covariate data; and ( ) with a propensity scoreâ€“adjusted analysis.16-20
The total numbers of IVF and IUI cycles and the subfertility diagnosis were imputed with multivariate imputation by chained equations.16,17 The imputation model was a negative binomial regression for numbers of IVF and IUI cycles and a nominal logistic regression for subfertility diagnosis. The model included year of first IVF treatment or first visit to a gynecologist; age at first IVF treatment or first visit to a gynecologist; and age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, number of births, body mass index, IVF clinic, total number of IUI cycles, subfertility diagnosis, breast cancer incidence, and the cumulative hazard calculated from a Cox proportional hazards model.18 For women with an unknown number of IVF cycles, the total number of IVF cycles was imputed and time since entry for each cycle was assigned based on the mean times among women with observed number of cycles and stratified by the number of births (0, 1, or > 1). The imputation process was repeated 10 times to create 10 full data sets. The Rubin rule was used to combine results of the models fitted to these 10 data sets.19
The propensity to undergo IVF treatment was calculated using a mixed-effects logistic model20 with random intercept and fixed effects for the same variables included in the imputation model (previously reported in this section). The propensity score was added to the Cox model as a continuous covariate to adjust the IVF treatment effect for confounding. The goodness-of-fit of the propensity score model, based on the McFadden pseudo R2, was 0.31, which is an excellent fit.21 Trend tests were based on the P value of the categoryspecific mean as a continuous variable.14 All tests of statistical significance were 2-sided and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed with Stata version 11.
Of 19 861 women in the IVF group and 6604 women in the nonIVF group, 1015 were excluded because of invalid addresses and 71 were excluded because of cancer diagnoses before before 1989 or cohort entry (including 3 breast cancers). Thus, 19 275 women in the IVF group and 6078 women in the nonIVF group were sent questionnaires; 64.2% responded (Figure).22 Medical records of 15 007 women were abstracted. The analytic study cohort consisted of 25 108 women; 19 158 women in the IVF group and 5950 women in the nonIVF group (Figure).22 In the description of the cohort, 952 women who were originally included in the non-IVF group but subsequently received IVF in another clinic were included in the IVF group (Table 1).
Table 1 lists the population characteristics by IVF exposure status. Women in the non-IVF group had a slightly longer follow-up duration after start of treatment (median, 23.5 years) than women in the IVF group (median, 20.7 years) and were older at end of follow-up (median age 55.3 years) than women in the IVF group (53.8 years) due to the inclusion of women seeking fertility treatment before the introduction of IVF treatment to yield sufficient numbers of non-IVF controls. Thirtyeight percent of women who received IVF treatment remained nulliparous vs 28% of the non-IVF group. The mean age at baseline was 32.8 years and the mean number of IVF cycles was 3.6 (Table 1). IVF stimulation regimens used in the cohort have been described previously.12,23,24 Most women underwent stimulation with hMG or FSH preceded by downregulation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Responders had more often received IVF (84.2% vs 62.6%), were less often nulliparous (33.0% vs 39.4%), had fewer births (mean, 1.5 vs 2.9), an older age at first birth (31.4 vs 29.5 years) than nonresponders, but similar ages at start and end of follow-up. In total, there were 839 cases of first 302 jama.com Adapted from Spaan et al.22 a According to the treatment center where these women were identified. b Women who were originally included in the non-IVF group but subsequently received IVF (eg, in another IVF clinic; n = 911 + 41 = 952) contributed person-time to both the non-IVF group and IVF group. c Women in this category contributed person-time from the first IVF treatment or first gynecological visit until date of death. d For unknown reasons, these women had originally not been identified as belonging in the IVF group; the women did not contribute person-time to the non-IVF group because IVF treatment was administered before 1989. invasive breast cancer and 109 of DCIS (Table 2). Sixty-four percent of breast cancers were diagnosed before age 51 years.
Breast cancer risks were not increased in the IVF group (SIR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.93-1.09) or the non-IVF group (SIR, 1.00 95% CI, 0.88-1.15) compared with the Dutch general population (Table 2). The SIR did not increase with longer time since treatment, neither in the IVF group (SIR, 0.92 for â‰¥20 years 95% CI, 0.73-1.15) nor in the non-IVF group (SIR, 1.03 for â‰¥20 years 95% CI, 0.82-1.29). The actual rates of breast cancer per 100 000 women were 163.5 for the IVF group and 167.2 for the non-IVF group as compared with 163.3 for the general population. The SIRs did not significantly differ by age at first treatment. The SIR was significantly decreased for nulliparous women (SIR, 0.86 95% CI, 0.76-0.97) but significantly increased for parous women (SIR, 1.10 95% CI, 1.02-1.20) (P < .001). The SIRs for breast cancer and DCIS combined were 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.08) for the IVF group, and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.86-1.11) for the non-IVF group (P = .70) (Table 2).
The cumulative incidences of breast cancer at the age of 55 years were 3.0% for the IVF group and 2.9% for the non-IVF group (P = .85). As shown in Table 3, breast cancer risk in the IVF group was not significantly different from the risk in the non-IVF group (HR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.86-1.19), adjusting for parity and age at first birth. When comparing the IVF group with a reference group of women who did not receive IVF, IUI, clomiphene, or any other fertility drug, the HR was not significantly increased (HR, 1.08 95% CI, 0.87-1.34 adjusted for parity). Within the IVF group, breast cancer risk decreased with more IVF cycles (P for trend = .001), with a significantly decreased risk with 7 cycles or more (HR, 0.55 95% CI, 303 0.39-0.77) compared with 1-2 IVF cycles. The HR for number of FSH and hMG ampules showed a similar significant trend, whereas the HR for number of IVF and IUI cycles combined did not. Breast cancer risk was significantly decreased (HR, 0.77 95% CI, 0.61-0.96) after poor response to the first IVF cycle ( < 4 collected oocytes) vs normal response (â‰¥4 collected oocytes). Within normal responders, breast cancer risk did not significantly differ according to number of collected oocytes. Breast cancer risk was not associated with subfertility diagnosis or (type of) luteal phase support.
The risks according to parity showed a similar pattern as the SIRs. In the entire cohort, parous women had a significantly increased risk compared with nulliparous women (HR, 1.35 95% CI, 1.16-3.73). Women who were 35 years or older at first birth had a significantly increased risk compared with women younger than 25 years at first birth (HR, 1.73 95% CI, 1.30-2.30 for age 35-39 years and HR, 2.52 95% CI, 1.71-3.73 for age 40 years or older).
When stratifying by timing of first birth, the risks of breast cancer for IVF vs no IVF were equal among women who were 1701 (14.4) 1045 (25.3) 2746 (10.9) 2428 (20.5) 1096 (26.5) 3524 (14.0) 4420 (37.3) 1244 (30.1) 5664 (22.6) 2782 (23.5) 645 (15.6) 3427 (13.6) 467 (3.9) 90 (2.2) 557 (2.2) 44 (0.4) 18 (0.4) 62 (0.2) available information) did not undergo IUI.

No significant differences in HRs for IVF vs no IVF were observed when stratifying analyses by attained age ( > 50 vs â‰¤50 years), by age at starting treatment ( < 30 vs 30-35 years and â‰¥36 years), or by time since treatment ( < 10 vs 10-19 and â‰¥20 years).
In analyses stratified by parity, breast cancer risk decreased with more IVF cycles among parous women (P for trend = .007), but not among nulliparous women (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Also, among parous women, breast cancer risk decreased significantly with fewer oocytes collected at first IVF cycle (P for trend = .01).
Four sensitivity analyses, using breast cancer and DCIS as a combined outcome (eTable 3 in the Supplement) among women who started treatment from 1989 onward (eTable 4 in the Supplement), multiple imputation for missing covariate data for those variables with nonnegligible proportions of missing values (eTable 5 in the Supplement), and propensity scoreâ€“ 305

Parous women had a higher breast cancer risk than nulliparous women, especially when they were 35 years or older at first birth.
The results of the current study are consistent with recent reviews that reported no increased breast cancer risk after IVF,9,25,26 and are based on a median follow-up of 21.1 years compared with a mean of 8 years9 and 16 years27 in prior studies. The most recent review and meta-analysis comprised 576 incident breast cancer cases among women exposed to IVF from 8 studies, of which only 3 compared IVF-treated women with infertile women not treated with IVF.27-29 In the largest previous study of 87 403 Danish subfertile women (mean follow-up, 8 years), breast cancer risk was not significantly different after treatment with or without ovarian stimulation.29 However, several studies observed increased breast cancer risk in subgroups, eg, after more than 4 cycles30 or 6 cycles of hMG31 or after more than 10 years since treatment.32 Stewart et al reported increased breast cancer risk among women who 18 620 1 Reference 146 847 0.96 (0.67-1.40) 93 499 0.82 (0.55-1.20) 119 714 1.08 (0.74-1.56) include male factor, tubal factor, unexplained, and other factors (eg, endometriosis and cervical factors).

Increased breast cancer risks following IVF have also been reported for women who remained nulliparous34 and for parous women.32 Few epidemiologic studies have had sufficient power to study the effects of different fertility drugs used in IVF or effect modification by other risk factors such as parity.25
Since IVF comprises several phases and treatment schedules changed over time, unraveling the potentially opposite effects of several components of the IVF procedure is challenging. Typically, the first phase in IVF treatment is down-regulation of a womanâ€™s natural menstrual cycle with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, followed by ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins, causing up to 10-times higher estradiol and progesterone levels than in natural menstrual cycles.6 If sufficient follicles have developed, 10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is adminis72 1824 41 979 0.93 (0.69-1.25) 33 894 20 964 0.88 (0.59-1.31) e Includes the major cause of subfertility (based on information from medical records if available and on information from questionnaires if no medical record information was available).
