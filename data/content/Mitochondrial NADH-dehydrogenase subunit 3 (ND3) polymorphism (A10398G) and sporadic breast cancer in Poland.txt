Mitochondria are subcellular organelles that produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). As suggested over 70 years ago by Otto Warburg and recently confirmed with molecular techniques, alterations in respiratory activity and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) appear to be common features of malignant cells. Somatic mtDNA mutations have been reported in many types of cancer cells, but very few reports document the prevalence of inherited mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms in cancer patients compared to healthy control populations. Here we report the abundance of the 10398G polymorphism in a Polish breast cancer population and its frequency in controls. Amongst individuals with breast cancer the G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is present in 23% of affected females compared to 3% of controls. This difference is highly statistically significant (P = 0.0008). It is therefore possible that the 10398G SNP constitutes an inherited predisposition factor for the development of breast cancer.
While the term ‘‘mitochondrial medicine’’ was coined in 1962 by Rolf Luft in his clinical report on nonthyroid hypermetabolism , it was not until 1988 that Holt, Harding and Morgan-Huges reported the association of human myopathy with a large deletion of the mitochondrial genome, and Wallace et. al. published their paper on a point mutation in the mtDNA of patients with Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy. Interestingly, the Leber’s mutation was also in NADH dehydrogenase (mitochondrial respiratory complex 1), as is the 10398 SNP considered in the current study. More recently mtDNA has been described as veritable Pandora’s box of pathogenic mutations associated with a wide variety of clinical syndromes . The number of known point mutations, deletions, and duplications of mtDNA exceeds 300 and new mutations are annotated every month. Also, the number of known polymorphisms is in excess of 1,000 . Population studies in the UK have shown that at least one in 8,000 adults harbors a pathogenic mtDNA mutation . The presence of respiratory chain disorders may be as high as 1 in 5,000 newborns . Several reports have found an association between somatic mtDNA mutations and cancer development, progression or metastasis . In addition, recent studies have shown that inherited polymorphisms or mutations of the mitochondrial genome may modulate the risk of developing cancer, including prostate, oral and colorectal cancers .
The 10398 nucleotide position (np) in the human mitochondrial genome is highly polymorphic. While the revised Cambridge reference sequence lists the wild type base as A, the alternate base (G) is also prevalent in many populations . Moreover analysis of this nucleotide position in clinical populations have yielded seemingly contradictory results as to which base is associated with disease. The 10398A SNP appears to be increased in neuro-degenerative aging diseases such as Parkinson’s disease , Alzheimer’s disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , but to protect against cardiomyopathy in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia . The controversy as to which base is associated with disease extends to cancer. While numerous studies have been carried out to determine if a correlation exists between risk for breast cancer and the A10398G polymorphism, a direct link has yet to be established.
To verify whether the inherited A10398G polymorphism may be involved in cancer development and to avoid any bias we used strict criteria in selecting a control population, avoiding cases with positive cancer family history in last two generations . Subsequently we analyzed the frequency of 10398G and 10398A alleles in cancer and control populations, matched for ethnicity and region of residence.
The project was approved by the local ethical committee at the Medical University of Warsaw (KB-0/6/2007 to AMC, KB-KB-0/7/2007 and KB-0/25/2007 to WK). Breast cancer specimens from 44 patients were obtained at the Monument Institute of Polish Mothers Health Center, 31 head and neck tumors at the Department of Otolaryngology, Czerniakowski Hospital and a healthy cohort (control group) of 100 individuals at the Department of Genetics and Pathology, International Hereditary Cancer Center, Pomeranian Medical University. All three populations share the same ethnicity and nationality and reside in Poland. This study did not include any individuals of Asian, African–American or Jewish origin. Tumor tissues of the studied cases were collected along with their matched normal tissues. Tumors were classified using standard histological criteria. Surgical and pathological staging was performed according to WHO recommendations. The group of control subjects consisted of 100 healthy females with a negative family history of cancer. The females were part of a population-based study of the 1.5 million Polish residents designed to identify familial aggregations of cancer by the International Hereditary Cancer Center. These controls were interviewed in 2007. Women affected with any malignancy, or with any cancers diagnosed in a first-degree relative were excluded from this control group. The breast cancer patients were mostly T1 patients including 5 pT1b patients, and 19 patients pT1c. Eighteen women were diagnosed with stage pT2 disease. Almost equal numbers of patients were lymph node negative (23 with pN0) and positive (10 with pN1, including 1 pN1a, 5 pN1bi, 1 pN1bii, 6 pN1biii, and 2 pN1biv). Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) staining were as follows: ER(0) = 16, ER(?) = 17, ER(??) = 2, ER(???) = 9; PR(0) = 15, PR(?) = 16, PR(??) = 3, PR(???) = 10. The mean age of the breast cancer population was 57, (median 58); with the 10398G mean age of 62 years (median 62); and 10398A population mean age 55 (median 57). The head and neck tumors population mean age was 58 years and median 57. Mean and median age of healthy population was 55 years.
Cancer and matched normal tissue DNA was isolated using a PUREGENE DNA Purification Kit (Gentra Systems) according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Healthy control DNA was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation from 10 cc blood samples. We have previously demonstrated that haplotypedefining SNPs may be determined on either blood or tissue DNA without changing haplotype SNP assignment .
mtDNA region 10361–10485 was amplified with AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) using forward primer 10361F 50-TCTGGCCTATGAGTGACTAC-30 and reverse primer 10485R 50-TGTAAATGAGGGGCATTT GG-30 at 95 C—10.00 min, (94 C—1.00 min, 49 C—1.30 min, 72 C—1.00 min) 9 40; 72 C 7.00 min. This resulted in a 124 base pair amplicon prior to digestion. Restriction reaction was performed on 20ll of PCR reaction in 30ll volume with 2 units of CviKI-1, a restriction endonuclease (New England Biolabs). The result of restriction reaction was verified on 3% Et-Br stained agarose gel (Sigma). When the base at position 10398 is A, only one CviKI-1 site is present and the band after digestion is at the 119 bp position, whereas when the base is G, the Cvi-KI-1 additional site is present and the digested band shifts 33 bp. This is shown in Fig. 1. To verify the result each sample was digested at least twice. Moreover the RFLP pattern has been further verified by RFLP analysis with Dde I enzyme (New England Biolabs). The Dde I site is present only when the 10398 base is a G and the band on 3% agarose gel after digestion shifts 34 bp.
difference in cancer and healthy (control) populations . To confirm the result of this common test in the light of low expected number in the healthy population Yates’s chi and un-corrected chi squared test (‘N - 1’ chi squared test) have been used as expected to give relatively low Type I error. The analysis was performed as previously described . To further understand the significance of A10398G analysis of risk factors for unfavorable outcomes (odds ratio, relative risk, difference in proportions, absolute and relative reduction in risk, number needed to treat) and of the effectiveness of a diagnostic criteria (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, diagnostic and error odds ratios) has been performed. The parameters, as well as the confidence intervals for the estimated parameters are computed by standard methods .
Unequivocal genotyping for the 10398 SNP was achieved in 100% of the study population (N = 175) by the RFLP approach described. Patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer had the 10398G 23% of the time (10/44) while the healthy, no breast cancer control group had the 10398G SNP only 3% of the time (3/100). This difference is highly statistically significant P = 0.0008389 (Fisher’s exact test), which was confirmed both by Yates corrected v2 = 12.18 and P = 0.0004840 and ‘N - 1’ v2 = 14.38 and P = 0.0001. For the breast cancer population this mutation had an odds ratio (OR) = 9.510 (2.639–33.867 at 95% CI) and relative risk (RR) = 7.576 (2.391–24.966 at 95% CI). Moreover this A10398G test is of high sensitivity = 0.769 (0.513–0.917 at 95% CI) and specificity = 0.740 (0.715– 0.755 at 95% CI) with subsequent diagnostic odds ratio = 9.510 (2.639–33.867 at 95% CI) and number needed to diagnose (NND) = 1.962 (1.489–4.392 at 95% CI). The 10398A polymorphism has a breast cancer negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.970 (0.937–0.989 at 95% CI) and relative risk reduction (RRR) = - 6.576 (-23.966 to -1.391 at 95% CI). Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized that this research must be confirmed in large populations prior to any clinical application .
To understand whether the 10398G polymorphism is specific for breast cancer in the Polish population, we also screened a small group of head and neck tumors: esthesioneuroblastoma, hard palate myxoma and laryngeal cancer. The head and neck tumor population was characterized by higher (10%) 10398G percentage of mutation than controls, but this difference is not statistically significant— two-tailed Fisher’s exact test has shown no significant difference between head and neck cancer and healthy group (P = 0.236) or breast cancer patients (P = 0.329, Table 1).
Classical breast cancer risk factors include age and gender (women over 50 years of age); early menstruation and late menopause (before age 12 and after age 55); no or late first labor (after the age of 30), oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or diethylstilbestrol (DES) intake; obesity (associated with higher levels of estrogen); alcohol consumption, chemicals (estrogen-like pesticides); and a positive family history of breast, uterine, ovarian, or colon cancer. Family history being a risk factor suggests possible inherited genetic susceptibility for breast cancer development. Today there is broad agreement that there are many genes involved in the process of breast carcinogenesis and that risk for breast cancer increases with each relevant genetic alteration present. In particular, 5–10% of breast cancers are associated with autosomal dominant inheritance of mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have a 6–85% cumulative lifetime risk of developing invasive breast cancer . Genes correlated with breast cancer susceptibility include also the ‘‘guardian of the genome’’ TP53, and genes of proteins from p53-DNA repair-pathways-the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog, also called mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1) gene, and the CHEK2 (protein kinase CHK2 isoform c) gene. Recent studies have revealed new breast cancer markers like NBS1/p95 and PALB2. PALB2 protein interacts with BRCA2, and is involved in homologous recombination and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks . Despite the established role of these genes in breast cancer, the list of genetic factors involved in this disease is still incomplete and more effort is needed to identify bio-markers and genetic alterations that would allow the selection of individuals with increased risk for intensive screening, prevention and treatment programs. We propose that mitochondrial DNA mutations are candidates for such a role.
The mitochondrial A10396G mutation came to the attention of the breast cancer research community a few years ago as a plausible candidate marker for increased breast cancer susceptibility in American populations . Moreover it is possible that this polymorphism and the consequent alteration of the ND3 protein might have broad implications for cancer cell physiology and serve as a breast cancer predisposition factor The 10398G variant has also been reported in prostate cancer. It is postulated to increase the incidence and severity of prostate cancer in African–American men . Moreover in a group of 21 thyroid tumors, 10398G has been found as a somatic mutation in a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), a low-grade follicular variant. The 10398G variant identified in PTC was also found as an inherited mutation in other individuals with non-PTC thyroid tumors as well as some normal controls .
The 10398 nucleotide position in the human mitochondrial genome is highly polymorphic. Amongst 2704 complete coding region sequences reported in the on line searchable database mtDB, the base is A in 1461 (54%), G in 1242 (46%), and T in a single case . It is also clear that in the United States, there is a marked racial difference in this particular base, with A being found in 9– 13% of African Americans and 79–80% of Caucasian Americans . This inverse relationship of base frequency and race could significantly confound any study that does not take ethnicity into consideration. There is also substantial diversity in the amino acid at this location (amino acid 114 in the ND3 peptide) across various species. In man the ‘‘wild type’’ amino acid (when the DNA base is A) is threonine, and the ‘‘mutant’’ amino acid is alanine (when the DNA base is G). Amongst 61 species (including man), the amino acid at position 114 is threonine in 27 (44%), alanine in 18 (30%) and another amino acid in 16 (26%) . The substitution of threonine (polar, neutral, hydropathy index -0.7) for alanine (nonpolar, neutral, with hydropathy index of 1.8) is relatively non-conservative from the perspective of chemical properties as reflected in a Grantham value of 58 . Threonine has a hydrophobicity value (H/) of 0.45 Kcal, and is thus classified as polar amino acid and tends to be found on the surface of proteins. The presence of threonine neither favors nor inhibits the formation of helical structure and threonine has no ionizable groups when found in protein molecules. Threonine can form hydrogen bonds cross-linking protein chains and moreover is susceptible to numerous posttranslational modifications. The hydroxy side chain may undergo O-linked glycosylation or phosphorylation. Alanine on contrary, has an H/ of 0.75 Kcal value, which suggests that is mildly hydrophobic and the a-carbon atom of alanine is bound with a methyl group (–CH3) and it has no ionizable groups when it is found in proteins. This aliphatic amino acid tends locate with almost equal frequency on the surface and interior of fully folded protein molecules and it promotes the formation of helical structure. The methyl group of alanine is non-reactive and is thus almost never directly involved in protein function . Unfortunately, the biochemical in vivo consequences of this particular amino acid substitution have not been studied. We do know however, that single base mutations in this respiratory complex can cause human disease.
The literature contains multiple conflicting reports regarding which base is associated with cancer. In 2005, Canter et al. found increased frequency of the 10398A SNP in African American women with invasive breast cancer. In this paper no difference in the frequency of A10398G in white women with invasive breast cancer in comparison with healthy woman was reported . The authors suggested that interaction of unknown genetic and environmental risk factors may cause the discrepancy between ethnic groups. In another larger, multi-cohort study, the 10398A SNP frequency was not increased in African American breast cancer cases compared with controls, and the total number of African American subjects was substantially larger in this study (*1,500 cases compared to *1,000 controls) . In this paper the authors claimed that differing results between the Setiawan study and Canter study may be explained by differences in risk modifiers that exist in diverse geographical areas. This leaves open the question whether 10398A is correlated with cancer development in African–American woman.
In another analysis of 69 mtDNA SNPs performed in 156 unrelated non-Jewish European–American female breast cancer cases compared to 260 age-matched, healthy, non-Jewish, European American female controls, it was the 10398G allele that was associated with increased risk of breast cancer (P = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) , a result that is concordant with our findings. In an Indian population case-control study the 10398A allele was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk breast cancer, but that study did not include analysis of age, stage, tumor differentiation, tumor size, extent of tumor or lymph node metastasis and tumor expression of ER and PR, premenopausal and post-menopausal status (Darvishi et al. ; Table 2). Because of these conflicting results we performed our analysis of breast cancer in Polish women.
To investigate A10398G we have chosen homogenous cancer and control populations. The Polish population is similar to the white European population , but is distinct from Indian populations and European–American populations and therefore the results of previous research cannot be directly compared with our report . Our results of a significant difference of the 10398G SNP frequency in breast cancer patients and controls with negative family history, suggests the involvement of 10398G in breast cancer, modifying the risk of developing breast cancer.
As the number of papers reporting 10398G in cancer patients increases (Table 2), the structural and pathological impact of 10398G becomes important to understand. Cells harboring the 10398A polymorphism have a lower mitochondrial matrix pH and altered calcium dynamics in the cytosol. The mitochondrial matrix pH is lower in cybrids with the 10398A than in containing the 10398G SNP. In addition, the 10398A cybrids have an increased concentration of Ca2? and tended to have higher peak cytosolic calcium levels after histamine stimulation as compared with the 10398G cybrids. This result suggests that cytosolic calcium response may be enhanced in the 10398A cybrids though a second alteration at np 8701 was also present in these experiments. The A8701G polymorphism is likely to alter cell physiology, as it is a non-synonymous change and has been previously reported in human cancer samples . Although no structural or apoptosis/proliferation data are currently available in 10398A and 10398G cells, one current hypothesis for A10398G proposes that increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may arise as a consequence of altered complex I function. This is especially important as increased free radical generation and local oxidative injury facilitate neoplastic transformation and metastasis . It is also possible that 10398G is more deleterious in African–Americans with breast cancer because African mitochondrial haplotypes may be prone to generate more reactive oxygen species than other haplotypes or because coexistent mutations in other mitochondrial or nuclear genes decrease cellular capacity to manage oxidative stress . However this remains to be demonstrated experimentally.
One could hypothesize that 10398G is a low-penetrance modifier of tumor risk that along with other mtDNA alterations may promote cancer development or arise as a consequence of nonspecific DNA damage, but cause and effect cannot be assigned at present . In this study we show that 10398G mtDNA polymorphism is significantly more frequent in cancer patients than in an age-matched cohort of woman with no breast cancer and low breast cancer risk (negative family history). Although a large scale population study is desirable, we propose that 10398G can be used as a marker to identify high-risk European individuals that should consider intensive screening to avoid late stage diagnosis and benefit from early diagnosis and treatment. The data indicate that mitochondrial genomic markers offer another way to track inherited cancer susceptibility in maternal lineages and therefore may one day constitute a useful tool to stratify cancer risk in women of European lineage . te la -egm lae 8G ts d lrea 6 ilim a0 fem 9103 raeb n 5 a 6 U 1 F 2 A s n a c i r e m A – n a e p o r u E n o i t a l u p o p tirrIeahndnn 4 iracod tllieac3hny lteahhoywm llleae398A 10398pGA ,lrahpogoN rccaen .983573G= .tlrsc6ono% (r)oFG= .001 o 2 p 7 0 0 3 R = 34 N 1 S 2 1 1 4 O P r e c n a
