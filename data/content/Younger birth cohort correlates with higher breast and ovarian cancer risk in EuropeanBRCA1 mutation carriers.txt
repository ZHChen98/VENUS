Mutations in the BRCA1 gene result in an elevated risk of breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC). However, risk estimates vary depending on the study population and statistical methodology used, and there are indications that the birth cohort and location of the mutation influence cancer risk. We investigated the risks for BC and OC associated with BRCA1 mutations in a young cohort of female mutation carriers who were identified by molecular genetic testing and belonged to a genetically heterogeneous Central European population. The study included 106 healthy and 158 affected carriers identified at an Austrian risk evaluation center. Risk estimation employed the product limit method. The log rank test was used to compare different strata. The risk of developing cancer to age 70 was found to be 85% for BC (95% CI 75-97%) and 53% for OC (95% CI 37-68%). Female mutation carriers born in 1958 or later were subject to a significantly higher risk of BC (P 5 0.005; 27% vs. 46% to age 40) and OC (P 5 0.006; 2% vs. 8% to age 40) than those born earlier. Mutations in exon 11 were associated with lower BC risk than mutations in exons 1-10 (P 5 0.008) and exons 12-24 (P 5 0.0006). OC risk was not influenced by mutation location (P 5 0.86). We conclude that female BRCA1 mutation carriers should be counseled about their cohort-dependent cancer risk. Further research into variables that affect cancer risk and are amenable to modification (e.g., lifestyle-related factors) should be considered a priority.

Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 (MIM 113705) result in a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC); however, risk estimates show considerable divergence. The highest BC risk estimates were found in the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium (BCLC) studies of selected high-risk families, reaching 85% to age 70, and the OC risk estimate was 63% . The majority of other studies were either hospital- or population-based and used the mutation carriers’ family history or case-control comparisons for risk estimation. Such studies produced distinctly lower risk values of 46–60% for BC and 16–37% for OC to age 70 , 2002; ; . A recent study of 212 female mutation carriers identified by molecular genetic testing determined risks of 69% for BC and 46% for OC .
The cited studies ; , 2002; ; examined a highly selective population, i.e., Ashkenazi Jewish families in which one of the two BRCA1 founder mutations (187delAG, approved systematic nomenclature: c.68–69delAG, known as 185delAG; and 5385insC, c.5266dupC, known as 5382insC) segregated. However, there are indications that mutations located in different regions of the BRCA1 gene are associated with varying risks of developing cancer ; . A study of 260 tested mutation carriers and 121 presumed carriers in a genetically heterogeneous sample collected at two risk evaluation centers in the United States calculated risk estimates of 73% for BC and 42% for OC to age 70 . It remains unclear to what extent these results may be applied to European mutation carriers who might harbor a different spectrum of mutations.
In recent years, genetic counseling and testing have been gradually transferred from a research setting to a clinical one. Consequently, clinical risk evaluation centers are increasing their efforts to provide counselees with risk estimates that reflect the specific population. Among the factors that need to be taken into account are the selection criteria for the population that frequents risk evaluation centers, and the spectrum of mutations found in the population at large. In addition, birth cohort should also be considered because there are indications that later birth cohorts (to which many of the women seeking counseling belong) are subject to an elevated BC risk ; .
To obtain accurate risk estimates for our population, we computed the probability of developing BC and OC for female BRCA1 mutation carriers identified at Austrian risk evaluation centers. Risk reduction due to prophylactic mastectomy (PM) or oophorectomy (PO) was taken into account. We compared the cancer risks for earlier- and later-born cohorts, and examined whether mutation position was associated with different risk levels in our sample.
Between December 1994 and November 2003, a total of 1,781 families received genetic counseling at the Division of Senology (Medical University of Vienna). The clients were at least 18 years of age and were either self-referred or had been referred by specialists. Individuals with a family history that met the selection criteria who opted for molecular genetic testing after pretest counseling gave their written consent before blood samples were collected. The selection criteria were as follows: on one side of the family at least 1) two cases of BC before the age of 50, 2) three cases of BC before the age of 60, 3) one case of BC before the age of 50 and one case of OC, 4) two cases of OC, 5) one case of BC before the age of 35, or 6) male and female BC.
If possible, the youngest affected member of a family underwent molecular genetic analysis first. In the absence of an affected family member opting for genetic testing, healthy index individuals were also selected to undergo molecular genetic analysis.
Of the 1781 families counseled at the center in Vienna, 472 families (26.5%) underwent genetic testing. An additional 377 families, whose anamneses met the same selection criteria, were identified at 28 cooperating counseling centers throughout Austria. In sum, 849 families with a total of 1,401 members were tested for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (MIM 600185) at the research laboratory of the Division of Senology (Medical University of Vienna) by means of DHPLC analysis and/or direct sequencing. The laboratory methods employed—DNA extraction, PCR, DHPLC, and direct sequence analysis—are described elsewhere ; ; .
Mutation numbering is based on cDNA, according to the GenBank reference sequence, accession number U14680.1. The approved systematic nomenclature (shown in parentheses) counts the A of the ATG translation initiation codon as 11 , while the traditional nomenclature used in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) Database (http:// research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/) follows the rule that the A of the ATG translation initiation codon is at position 120.
The study included all women who were identified as carriers of a cancer-associated BRCA1 mutation from December 1994 to November 2003. Furthermore, pedigrees were analyzed to identify all women who had not been tested, but were located in direct succession between two tested mutation carriers with identical BRCA1 mutations. The former are known as ‘‘obligate carriers,’’ whereas women who have undergone molecular genetic testing are referred to as ‘‘tested carriers.’’
From the mutation carriers enrolled in the study, the following data were recorded: year of birth (YOB), year of death if applicable, BC and OC cancer status, age at diagnosis if applicable, exact position and type of BRCA1 mutation, carrier status (tested carrier vs. obligate carrier), degree of relationship (i.e., in reference to the index individual), status regarding PM and PO, and age at prophylactic surgery if applicable. Data from tested carriers were provided either by the women directly or via one of the cooperating counseling centers. Regular contact with the mutation carriers (via the carrier clinic or by questionnaire) and close cooperation with the other counseling centers ensured that the data were current. Data concerning obligate carriers were extracted from the pedigrees, which are based on information provided by tested family members and are likewise updated regularly by means of questionnaires. Cancer diagnosis, age at diagnosis, PM/PO status, and age at PM/PO were confirmed by a pathologist’s report or clinical report whenever feasible. The institutional ethics committee confirmed that the study protocol met all ethical standards.
For the purposes of risk estimation, cumulative proportions of BC and OC, respectively, over age were calculated using the product limit method (PROC Lifetest, SAS/STATs, version 8. 1999; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Probands were censored if they had not developed BC/OC until November 2003, if they had died from other causes before that date, or had undergone PM or PO, whichever occurred first. Pointwise confidence intervals were given in 10-year intervals. Hazard functions were calculated using the kernel smoothing method . Epanechnikov kernels with a 10-year bandwidth were employed. Asymptotic local confidence intervals for this estimated value were calculated on the basis of normal approximation.
To identify possible bias, risk functions of tested and obligate carriers were compared, as well as those of index individuals, firstdegree relatives, and second-degree relatives. Subsequently the cancer risks of distinct birth cohorts and mutations were tested for differences. In comparing the risk functions of different strata, the log rank test (two-sided, PROC Lifetest; SAS) with a significance level of a 5 0.05 was employed.
A cancer-associated mutation in BRCA1 was found in 160 of 849 tested families (18.8%). A total of 246 female carriers of a BRCA1 mutation were identified by molecular genetic testing.
An additional 18 women were included in the study as obligate carriers. Fifty-one different BRCA1 mutations were identified, with 35 mutations (68.6%) each occurring in a single family. Only 35 women (13.3%) carried one of the two Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations (185delAG: 10 women from eight families; and 5382insC: 25 women from 18 families). Of the 264 probands, 58 (22%) carried a mutation in exons 1–10, 137 (52%) in exon 11, and 69 (26%) in exons 12–24. Table 1 shows the exact location of the mutations on the BRCA1 gene, as well as the mutations’ frequencies.
The median YOB was 1958. The average time until censoring was 40.6 years in the case of BC and 43.6 years for OC. Of 264 mutation carriers, 106 (40.2%) were healthy, 116 (43.9%) were affected with BC, 24 (9.1%) were affected with OC, and 18 (6.8%) were affected with both BC and OC. Twenty-one of the 134 BC patients (15.7%) were affected bilaterally, with an average of 7 years (minimum: 0 years, maximum: 15 years) elapsing aNumbering based on the GenBank reference sequence accession  U14680.1.

On average, 6 years (minimum: 0 years, maximum: 15 years) elapsed between diagnosis of the first and second carcinomas. At the time the data were analyzed, 37 women (14.0%) had already died, at an average age of 49 years. Of the surviving 227 carriers, a total of 64 (28%) underwent either PM or PO or both. Median age was 43 years (range: 29–57 years) at the time of PM, and 44 years (range: 28–59 years) at PO (Table 2).
The cumulative risk of developing BC was established at 61% (95% CI: 54–69) to age 50, and 85% (75–97%) to age 70 (Fig. 1).
Half of the BC cases occurred until the age of 45 years. For OC, the cumulative risk was established at 25% (16–33%) to age 50 and at 53% (37–68%) to age 70. The median age at diagnosis was 65 years. A comparison of the risk functions of tested and obligate carriers revealed no significant difference for either BC (P 5 0.69) or OC (P 5 0.61). Risk functions did not vary for index individuals, first-degree relatives, or second-degree relatives (BC: P 5 0.77, OC: P 5 0.29).
When the sample was subdivided according to the median birth year, women born in 1958 or later showed a significantly higher risk for BC and OC than women born before 1958 (BC: P 5 0.005, OC: P 5 0.006; Figs. 2 and 3). Given the high median value, we additionally subdivided the sample based on the cutoff year 1940, in analogy to one previous study . This also produced higher cancer risk estimates for younger women, although the difference was only marginally significant in the case of OC (BC: P 5 0.02, OC: P 5 0.08). The BC and OC risk estimates for all subgroups at ages 40 and 60 are shown in Table 3.
The question as to whether different mutations are associated with varying cancer risks was investigated on several levels. In analogy to a previous study , we first compared the risks associated with mutations located before and after nucleotide 4400, respectively. Mutations in the 30 region carried a significantly higher BC risk than those in the 50 region (P 5 0.0008), but no difference in OC risks was found (P 5 0.20).
Next, we subdivided the gene into three segments at nucleotides 2400 and 4190, according to another published model , and once again compared risk functions. This also revealed differences regarding BC risk (P 5 0.03); however, post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction (akorr 5 0.016) showed that only the central segment and the 30 segment differed significantly, with the risk in the central segment being lower than in the 30 region (P 5 0.006). Regarding the OC risk, there was no difference between the three segments (P 5 0.99).
To relate our results with those from the single study conducted at a risk evaluation center , we carried out another comparison by dividing the gene into three segments consisting of exons 1–10, exon 11, and exons 12–24. This comparison also produced no difference for OC (P 5 0.86) but again showed a difference for BC (P 5 0.0008; Fig. 4). Post hoc comparisons (akorr 5 0.016) demonstrated that risks associated with mutations in exons 1–10 (P 5 0.008) and exons 12–24 (P 5 0.0006) were significantly higher compared to mutations in the central exon 11.
Although we were aware of the limited sample size, we finally compared the risk functions of single mutations. The four most frequent mutations–300T4G (c.181T4G), 1806C4T (c.962G4A), 3135del4 (c.3016–3019delCATT), and 5382insC– aNumber of women who had not undergone mastectomy resp. oophorectomy before genetic testing. Data are given as cumulative risks (95% con¢dence intervals). Women born in 1958 or later had a signi¢cantly higher risk of BC (log rank: P 5 0.005) and OC (P 5 0.006) than women born before 1958. The corresponding numbers for women born before 1940 and women born later were P 5 0.02 and P 5 0.08. aNot applicable. bNo events yet. were treated as separate strata, and the remaining mutations were subsumed in one stratum. Regarding OC, the five strata showed no significant difference (P 5 0.84). For BC, however, different mutations were associated with different risk functions (P 5 0.02;
Fig. 5). Post hoc comparisons (akorr 5 0.0125) demonstrated that the 5382insC mutation resulted in a higher risk compared to that of the reference group with mixed mutations (P 5 0.008). No significant differences between the other mutations and the mixed stratum were found (300T4G: P 5 0.20, 1806C4T: P 5 0.25, 3135del4: P 5 0.52).
With 85% (CI: 75–97%) to age 70, the BC risk estimate derived from our data is on the same level as the BCLC results , and is higher than that reported by all other studies ; ; , 2002; ; and one meta-analysis . The average cumulative risk by age 70 for OC was 53%, which is in the upper range of previous results. It should be noted that because of the lower case numbers, the calculations regarding OC are less precise, which becomes apparent in the rather wide CI of 37–68%.
A crucial aspect of estimating risk in carriers of a genetic predisposition is proband ascertainment. It has been argued that estimating cumulative age-specific cancer risks for defined subpopulations is more useful than calculating one ‘‘average’’ penetrance for all carriers of a BRCA1 (or BRCA2) mutation, since penetrance may be modified by other risk factors aggregating in families ; ; . Accordingly, we regard our results as being applicable to BRCA1 mutation carriers identified at risk evaluation centers, but not to other populations. It is not surprising that our risk estimates are higher than those reported for populations sampled by index cases that were unselected regarding family history ; , 2002; ; ; , but they are also higher than those observed in one study that investigated mutation carriers identified at a risk evaluation center . There are several potential explanations for this, as discussed below.
In our study, risk estimation was based on women with an identified mutation, and obligate carriers only, which rules out the potential for bias when including family members who were not genotyped. Since this method can lead to overestimation of risk if individuals who carry a higher risk within a family are more likely to participate in genetic testing ; , we examined whether affected family members were overrepresented in our study. This analysis was restricted to all living and deceased daughters, sisters, and mothers of index probands (n 5 386) because information on cancer status was less reliable for more distant relatives. The proportion of female first-degree relatives included in the study was marginally higher among unaffected individuals than among carriers affected with BC and/or OC (39.9% vs. 30.6%; w2 5 3.572, P 5 0.059), which speaks against overestimation of cancer risks. When only sisters were analyzed, unaffected and affected women did not differ significantly regarding inclusion in the study (n 5 179; 44.7% vs. 38.5%; w2 5 0.667, P 5 0.414). Furthermore, our sampling method (i.e., healthy family members could also undergo genetic testing as index individuals) proved advantageous because no differences in cancer risk were found between index probands, first-degree relatives, and more distant relatives, and there were no differences in risk between tested and obligate carriers either.
Another possible explanation for our high risk estimates is that the populations of U.S. and Central European risk evaluation centers may harbor different mutation spectra. To explore this hypothesis, we compared the mutations’ distributions on the gene. Indeed, in our sample the proportion of mutations in exons 1–10 at 22% was lower, and the proportion of mutations in exon 11 at 52% was higher than in the U.S. sample (exons 1–10: 45%, exon 11: 31%). However, given that in our sample the risk associated with mutations in exon 11 was significantly lower than in the other segments, this factor obviously does not account for the above differences.
Our data point to another possible explanation, the fact that our sample included by far the youngest birth cohort examined to date. One previous study reported a significantly higher risk of BC (though not of OC) in women born after 1940, which was also shown to be true for our sample. When we compared probands born before and after 1958, the effect was even more pronounced and also extended to OC risk. Similar effects of birth cohort were also found in a meta-analysis of studies based on index cases .
Considering that the 264 probands came from a total of 160 different families, and the sample included only 11 mother– daughter pairs in which both individuals had developed BC, it seems improbable that the differences in risk are due to the genetic phenomenon of anticipation. Therefore, we conclude that the birth year is an important moderator variable for the risks associated with BRCA1 mutations.
Furthermore, our results add to the growing evidence ; that mutations in the central region of the gene are associated with a lower BC risk than those located at either end, although the optimum breakpoint between the 50 end and the central segment remains to be determined. OC risk did not vary with the mutation’s position, regardless of whether segments or individual mutations were compared. For BC, only the 5382insC mutation showed a significantly higher risk than the mixed stratum, though the risk functions suggest that other existing differences failed to register as significant owing to the limited sample sizes (Fig. 5).
Our study is the first to provide BC and OC risk estimates for BRCA1 mutation carriers identified at a risk evaluation center that takes into account prophylactic surgery. Although the rates of bilateral PM (8%) and PO (27%) in healthy mutation carriers lie at the lower end of previously reported findings , probably due to the low average age of our sample, it should be noted that 32% of healthy individuals were censored in the statistical risk estimation because they had undergone prophylactic surgery.
It is a limitation of our study that potentially risk-moderating variables other than PM and PO could not be taken into account, since such data are available from only about half of our sample at this time. However, hormonal and reproductive factors , as well as exercise and weight , have been shown to moderate cancer risks in BRCA1 mutation carriers. In addition, the introduction of mammographic screening, especially in young women from high-risk families, may have contributed to the elevated BC risk in later-born cohorts, since there is evidence of increased radiosensitivity in BRCA1heterozygous cells . With respect to the higher risk estimates for later-born mutation carriers, the investigation of such modifiers should be considered a priority in epidemiological research.
Another limitation is that our data are insufficient to conclude whether the results reflect an increase in lifetime cancer risks or a shift toward earlier age of onset, given the similar lifetime risks observed in different cohorts. A longer follow-up period will be needed to decide this question. Nonetheless, the present evidence warrants the modification of genetic counseling in clinical risk evaluation centers, since female BRCA1 mutation carriers should be informed about their cohort-dependent, age-specific cancer risks. Although the current data are not yet precise enough to counsel mutation carriers accordingly, further investigation of location-specific cancer risks seems promising.
