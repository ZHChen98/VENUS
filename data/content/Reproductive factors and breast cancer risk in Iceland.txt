In a previous prospective study we showed elevated risks for breast cancer in nulliparous women compared to parous women, in those havingtheir first pregnancyat a higher age, and those with few children. This was based on 216 women diagnosed with breast cancer during 1965 to 1975 among 34,525 women having attended the cervix cancer detection clinic in Iceland by the end of 1974, and born between 1906 and 1945. The present investigationon 848 cases, diagnosed among 6 1,040 women attending the cervix cancer detection clinic during 1964 to 1984 and born between 1901 and 1960, shows the same risk factors to be significant. The relative risks are, however, smaller. The reasons for the difference in relative risks are discussed, We find that the effect of age at first birth is significant for women up to the age of 65 and not for older women. In both cohorts, women older than 55 are underrepresentedand more so in the earlier report. In addition, the small number of cases in the reference group with age at first birth below 20 appearsto have made the figuresof our earlier report unreliable.
Studies are in progress on the epidemiology of breast cancer in Iceland (Bjarnason et a l . , 1974; Tulinius et al., 1978, 1982, 1985, 1988, 1990; Sigvaldason and Tulinius, 1980; Tryggvad6ttir et al., 1988).
A prospective study on the effect of reproductive factors on the risk of breast cancer has been published (Tulinius et al., 1978). This confirmed the importance of age at first pregnancy as shown by MacMahon et al. (1970) and, in addition, found that parity and age at menarche were significant risk factors. Most studies have confirmed these findings, but not all. Among the studies from the Nordic Countries, those by Soini (1977), Lund (1989) and Mellemgaard et al. (1990) confirmed age at first pregnancy as being an important risk factor. Other important population-based studies from the Nordic Countries (Adami et a l . , 1980; Meirik et al., 1986; ; Ewertz and Duffy, 1988) did not detect a significant association between age at first birth and breast cancer risk. With this in mind, a meeting, supported by the Nordic Council, was held in the Icelandic Cancer Registry in Rey , for which the data presented here were prepared. The meeting, attended by representatives from the 5 Nordic countries, recommended that a meta-analysis of the Nordic data be performed to try to resolve the difference in conclusions from the different studies. (Ewertz et a l . , in press).
The purpose of the analysis reported here is to determine if an additional 11 years of follow-up of the cohort of women attending the Icelandic Cervix Cancer Detection Clinic would seriously alter the conclusions of our earlier investigation, which were that both high age at first childbirth and low parity are risk factors for breast cancer in Icelandic women.
As described in our previous report (Tulinius et a l . , 1978), the Icelandic Cancer Society has operated a cervix cancer screening program since 1964. Information is obtained from all women attending the clinic on several parameters, including menstrual and reproductive history.
The study cohort was composed of all women attending the cervix cancer detection clinic one or more times during the years 1964 to 1984 inclusive. This number is 61,040 as shown in Table IA. Table IB shows the proportion of all breast cancer cases in Iceland included in the cohort by time of diagnosis.
The Icelandic Cancer Registry is population-based and has been in operation since 1954. It was searched for women among the cohort who had been diagnosed with their first breast cancer (including intraductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ, 33 cases), in the calendar year following their first visit to the detection clinic and before the end of 1986. Persons in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the end of the calendar year of their first visit to the clinic were omitted, and so were second breast cancers occumng in a woman already identified. Also omitted were 6 women who were diagnosed but were over 79. Thus, 848 women were identified. The contribution from Iceland to the meta-analysis (Ewertz et a l . , in press) already mentioned comprised 769 cases diagnosed before the end of 1985.
The observation period begins on the January 1 of the year following the first visit to the clinic and ends on the December 31, 1986, at death, or at diagnosis of breast cancer.
Expected numbers are calculated by using a mathematical model for dependence of incidence on year of birth and age, based on the breast cancer incidence of the whole Icelandic population 1910 to 1985. In an earlier publication (Bjarnason et a!., 1974) the multiplicative effects of year of birth and age have been demonstrated. We have found that the age dependence of the incidence could be adequately described by 2 exponential curves, one for age below 45 years and another for age over 45.
We obtained the following equations for females: I = 0.0077 * Exp (0.023 * X + 0.15 * t), t < 45 years I = 0.83 * Exp (0.023 * X + 0.046 * t), t 2 45 years where
I: incidence per 100,OOOper year, 1800 + X: calendar year of birth
t: age in years.
The observed and expected numbers were calculated for each subgroup under observation and the relative risks estimated as the ratios between these numbers, the relative risk of the reference group each time set being equal to one. The confidence limits were computed by estimating the variance of the logarithms of ratios as the sum of inverses of observed numbers. This model was tested in 2 ways. First, Table IA shows expected number of cases together with observed values and the latter are about 10% lower, but this discrepancy does not appear to depend on year of birth. Secondly, Poisson regression was performed controlling for year of birth and age. The results were nearly exactly the same for the age at first birth effect, but the effect of parity was somewhat reduced.

RESULTS
Table I1 shows the results on the relative risks for parity and age at first childbirth. The relative risk for nulliparous versus parous women is 1.23 (Table IIA).The relative risk for number of births (Table IIB)is 1.45 comparing mothers of 1 or 2 with mothers of 5 children or more (confidence intervals 1.201.77), and for age at first childbirth (Table IIc) it is 2.30 comparing age 35 or older with age below 20 (confidence intervals 1.61-3.28).
Table I11 shows the relative risks associated with combination of age at first birth and parity. The relative risk for women having their first child when older than 34 and having no more TABLE I1 - A. RELATIVE RISK FOR PARITY

Table IV shows the relative risks associated with combination of age at first birth, parity, and age at diagnosis of breast cancer. The effects of age at first birth are strongest for breast cancer diagnosed at ages below 45, and for parity before the age of 55. They are not significant for age at first birth for breast cancer diagnosed after the age of 64, and for parity after the age of 54.
No significant interaction was found between effects of age at first birth and parity on the breast cancer risk. On the other hand, the effect of age at first birth acts significantly more strongly in women below age 55 than in older women.
In order to find out if the reduction in relative risk is a birth cohort effect, Table V shows the relative risks of age at first birth and parity by year of birth cohorts. If there is a year of birth effect, this is too weak to be seen here.
The main purpose of this analysis was to investigate whether the findings described in our earlier publication on reproductive risk factors for breast cancer (Tulinius et al., 1978) would be repeated when the results on 22 years of observation and 848 cases were analysed. The findings were that nulliparity, low parity and high age at first childbirth are significant risk factors for breast cancer. The relative risks found in the present analysis are, however, considerably lower than those found previously.
In Table IV the cases are classified by age at diagnosis of breast cancer into 4 groups. The first is pre-menopausal, 2544, the second pen-menopausal, 45-54 and last 2 are postmenopausal groups, 55-64 and 65-79. For age at first birth all but the last group, 65-79, are significant, with the strongest relative risk for the pre-menopausal group, 3.51. When age at diagnosis was divided into 4 groups no significant interaction was found. When, however, these are merged into 2 groups, below 55 and over 55, the effect of age at first birth is significantly stronger for those diagnosed with breast cancer at younger age, p = 0.002.
These results show that the age at first birth is more important as a risk determinant for relatively young breast cancer cases, and is not important for the oldest cases. This agrees with the findings of ) and others , and also with our previous findings (Sigvaldason and Tulinius, 1980) where we showed that age at first birth and nulliparity had more effect in younger age groups than in the other ones (Fig. 1).
The irregularity of the breast cancer age incidence curve, often referred to as “Clemmesens’s hook”, could possibly be explained by this. The explanation would be that “breast cancer” is a heterogeneous group consisting of 2 or more subgroups; one group mostly in pre-menopausal women and another mostly in post-menopausal women with a strong increase in incidence by age, as in many other cancers. The
TULINIUS E T AL. summation of these 2 incidence curves could produce this irregularity. The excess risk for nulliparous women and those with a high age at first childbirth would contribute to the risk of the first subgroup (Fig. 1).
For parity, however, the relative risk is highest for the perimenopausal group and that is the only age group which shows significance for trend. The youngest age group, diagnosed below the age of 45, has not completed reproduction at that time, and childbirth after treatment for breast cancer is unlikely.
In agreement with our earlier publication (Tulinius et a l . , 1978) and that of ) we do not find a significant interaction between the effect of parity and that of age at first childbirth on the breast cancer risk.
Table VI compares those diagnosed in 1965-75 with those diagnosed in 1976-86. The figures for relative risk are agestandardized to Segi’s “World” population. The figures for the parity effect are very similar for the 2 cohorts while the figures for age at first birth differ widely. The small number of cases in the reference group in the earlier cohort (13) has a great variance (coefficient of variation about 30%).Therefore, figures are shown in parentheses using the age at first birth group 20 to 24 years as reference. The figures are now rather similar between the cohorts.
The differences between the 2 cohorts are mainly that the earlier one spanned year of birth cohorts from 1906-45, whereas the later cohort spanned years of birth from 1901-60, and that the earlier used information from the first visit to the cervix cancer detection clinic while the later used information from the last visit.
It can be argued that it would not serve the best interest of REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS AND BREAST CANCER RISK IN ICELAND TABLE VI - COMPARISON BETWEEN THE COHORT PRESENTED EARLIER

Possible bias would arise from the possibility that cases were more likely to have their parity information corrected to a higher parity class than the control population. This bias would lower the relative risks associated with parity, and more so if the observation period was longer.

However, such lack of correction of parity among controls should have less effect on the risk associated with age at first birth since the lack of correction would erroneously classify as nulliparous those women who had their first birth after the first visit to the clinic. The lowest age at invitation to the detection clinic was 25 and only recently has it been lowered to 20. The correction would therefore place them in one of the 3 highest groups of age at first childbirth which have relative risks more similar to those of the nulliparous women than to those of the 2 youngest groups of age at first childbirth.
Since the birth dates of each child are not available from the detection clinic files, it is not possible to reconstruct the exact reproductive history of each woman in order to find out whether spacing of all births and age at last childbirth have independent effects on the relative risks associated with reproduction ( ).
The secular increase in breast cancer incidence has continued (Hakulinen et al., 1986; Tulinius et al., 1988). The mortality rates have, however, remained practically constant over 30 years. An analysis of the trends in age at menarche and other parameters related to reproduction and growth are under study and will be reported later.
We conclude that age at first birth and parity are both significant risk factors for breast cancer. The former is strongest for breast cancer before age 45,but significant up to age 65.
Parity has weaker effects, strongest at the pen-menopausal age of 45-54. Biological explanations of this finding are still lacking, but the effect of age at first birth and nulliparity may contribute to the excess incidence in age groups 35 to 55, known as “Clemmensen’s hook”. women.
