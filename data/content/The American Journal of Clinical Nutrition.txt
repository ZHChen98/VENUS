Background: Excessive sugar intake is now recognized as a key risk factor for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, evidence on the sugar–cancer link is less consistent. Experimental data suggest that sugars could play a role in cancer etiology through obesity but also through inaflmmatory and oxidative mechanisms and insulin resistance, even in the absence of weight gain.
Objective: The objective was to study the associations between total and added sugar intake and cancer risk (overall, breast, and prostate), taking into account sugar types and sources.
Methods: In total, 101,279 participants aged > 18 y (median age, 40.8 y) from the French NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort study (2009–2019) were included (median follow-up time, 5.9 y). Sugar intake was assessed using repeated and validated 24-h dietary records, designed to register participants’ usual consumption for > 3500 food and beverage items. Associations between sugar intake and cancer risk were assessed by Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for known risk factors (sociodemographic, anthropometric, lifestyle, medical history, and nutritional factors).
Results: Total sugar intake was associated with higher overall cancer risk (n = 2503 cases; HR for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.37; Ptrend = 0.02). Breast cancer risks were increased (n = 783 cases; HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.00; Ptrend = 0.0007). Results remained significant when weight gain during follow-up was adjusted for. In addition, significant associations with cancer risk were also observed for added sugars, free sugars, sucrose, sugars from milk-based desserts, dairy products, and sugary drinks (Ptrend ≤ 0.01).
Conclusions: These results suggest that sugars may represent a modiafible risk factor for cancer prevention (breast in particular), contributing to the current debate on the implementation of sugar taxation, marketing regulation, and other sugar-related policies. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03335644. Am J Clin Nutr 2020;00:1–13.
Despite public health recommendations and dietary guidelines of the WHO advising to limit “free sugars” including both added and natural sugars present in fruit juices, honey, and syrups ( ) up to 5% of calories ( ), consumption remains excessive in most occidental countries ( ). For instance, in the United States, 13% of total energy is brought by free sugars ( ), and in France, sugars from sugary products contribute to 11% of energy intake ( ) and 20% of adults exceed 100 g of sugar per day i.e., the official recommendation ( ).

While the associations of sugars on cardiometabolic outcomes have been extensively studied ( ), associations with cancer risk have been much less investigated. Given the limited and inconsistent existing literature, the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) concluded, in their latest report ( ), that the evidence base was not sufficient for a sugar and cancer association. Similarly, Makarem et al. ( ) recently performed a systematic review on sugars and related exposures and overall and sitespecific cancers but concluded that, despite strong mechanistic plausibility, epidemiological data were still limited. Pancreatic ( ) and other gastrointestinal ( ) cancers have been the main cancer sites studied so far. In contrast, few studies have explored the associations between sugars and breast ( ) and prostate ( ) cancers, which are the most prevalent cancers in women and men, respectively, in several countries ( ), and even fewer studies considered added sugars in relation with breast ( ) and prostate cancers ( ). Literature on added sugars is even more limited due to methodologic limitations of dietary assessment tools in many cohort studies (i.e., FFQs), which do not adequately capture added sugar intake.
To better understand the etiologic role of sugars in carcinogenesis and refine nutritional recommendations concerning sugar intakes, it is important to identify types and sources of sugars more specicfially involved. Several studies have investigated associations between sugary food groups, considering the quantity eaten (in grams of food per day) and cancer risk ( ), but none specifically studied sugar intake from these specific sugary food groups (in grams of sugars from food groups per day). Sugary beverages, which contribute to a substantial part of sugar intake in Western countries ( ), have been the most investigated source, and several studies suggest an increased risk of various cancer sites ( ). In particular, within the NutriNet-Santé cohort, we recently showed that sugary drinks were associated with higher overall and breast cancer risk ( ). Some studies have identified associations for the different types of individual sugars and cancer risk, in particular, for fructose ( ), glucose ( ), and sucrose ( ), but results were coniflcting. Mechanistic plausibility supports sugar involvement in carcinogenesis. Excessive sugar intake is a known risk factor for adiposity, obesity, and cardiometabolic perturbations, which are, in turn, established risk factors for different cancer sites ( ). It has also been suggested that sugars are associated with other risk factors for cancer, such as oxidative stress and inaflmmation ( ) or activation of the insulin pathway causing insulin resistance ( ), even in the absence of weight gain.
Thus, there is a knowledge gap for types of sugars and sources and their link with cancer risk. Existing evidence is coniflcting, and much of it comes from US cohorts, which may be different from European populations. Given the policy and public health implications, it is important to establish a stronger evidence base. Our objective was to investigate the associations between dietary intakes of sugars (naturally present and added) and their food sources with overall cancer risk and risk of the most common nonskin cancers in men and women.
NutriNet-Santé, an ongoing web-based cohort launched in 2009, aims at studying associations between food and nutrient intakes, dietary behaviors, nutritional status, and health. It has been described in detail previously ( ). Briefly, participants are adult volunteers (age range: 18.0–72.6 y) from all regions of France with access to the Internet. They have been continuously recruited from the general population since May 2009 by means of vast multimedia campaigns, press conferences, health care professional channels, and so on ( ). When participants enter the NutriNet-Santé cohort, they create an account on the study website. The online platform is designed to send on average 1 questionnaire per month, to collect additional information. Participants cannot enter the study if they are < 18 y old, without Internet access, or non-French speaking. All information collected is strictly anonymous and an electronic informed consent is provided. The NutriNet-Santé study, registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03335644, is conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines and is approved by the Institutional Review Board of the French Institute for Health and Medical Research and the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés (n◦908,450/n◦909,216).
Data were obtained using self-administrated questionnaires completed by participants using a dedicated web interface (etude-nutrinet-sante.fr). Baseline was defined as the time they completed a set of 5 questionnaires on demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle characteristics ( ) (e.g., sex, date of birth, educational level, occupation, smoking status, number of children), anthropometric data ( ) (height, weight), health status (e.g., personal and family history of diseases; menopausal status; drug use, including for women oral contraceptive and use of hormonal treatment for menopause), physical activity validated 7-d International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( ), and dietary intakes.
At baseline and every 6 mo (to vary season of completion), participants completed a series of 3 nonconsecutive, web-based 24-h dietary records validated against an interview by a trained dietitian ( ) and compared with blood and urinary biomarkers ( ), randomly assigned over a 2-wk period (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day). Participants reported all foods and drinks consumed for the 3 main meals and any additional eating occasion. Portion sizes were estimated by participants using validated photographs or usual containers ( ). To assess daily intakes of alcohol, micronutrients, macronutrients (including sugar), and energy, consumption data were linked to the NutriNetSanté food composition database, which contains > 3500 items ( ). Intakes from composite dishes were estimated by referring to French recipes validated by nutrition professionals. Dietary underreporting was identified by the basal metabolic rate and Goldberg cutoff ( ) method, and energy underreporters were excluded (detailed methodology for underreporting is presented in Supplementary Method 1). Baseline usual dietary intakes were averaged from all 24-h dietary records provided during the first 2 y of follow-up (15 dietary records maximum). At least 2 dietary records were mandatory to enter the study.
In the present study, exposure variables of interest were total sugars, added sugars, specific types of sugar (glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose, and sucrose—also named saccharose), and sugars from different sugary foods and beverages. Sugary food items were clustered into 7 groups: dairy products (all types of milk, yogurts, and cottage cheese, with a sugar content ≤12%), other milk-based desserts (creams, entremets, custards/pudding/afln, milkshakes, and sugary yogurts and cottage cheese with a sugar content > 12%), sugary cereals (breakfast cereals and cereal bars with a sugar content ≥20%), cookies/cakes and pastries (all types of cookies/biscuits, cakes, baked goods, and pastries), sugary products (candies, sweets, honey, jam, table sugar, sweetened fruit purees, coulis, toppings, syrups, sweetened condensed milk, chocolate, ice cream, sorbets, spreads), fruit (fresh, canned, and pureed fruit with no added sugars and dried fruit), and sugary drinks (nonalcoholic sugarsweetened beverages and 100% fruit juices).
Participants’ health status was described at enrollment and reassessed every 6 mo by a checkup questionnaire. At any time during follow-up, participants could also report a health event, a new treatment, or a medical examination via a dedicated and secured online platform. Every reported cancer case was adjudicated by an expert medical committee, based on medical and anatomopathologic reports collected from the participants, their physicians, and/or hospitals. Cases were classified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision ( ). The NutriNet-Santé study also had access to databases from the National Health Data System. Linkage of the cohort to the national medical databases of the health insurance (Système National d’Information Inter-Régimes de l’Assurance Maladie) and to the French cause-specific mortality registry (CépiDC) enabled the completion of death and health data and limited potential bias due to unreported cancer cases. In this study, all first primary cancers diagnosed between the inclusion and January 7, 2019, were considered cases, except for basal cell carcinomas, which were not considered cancer. In total, 2503 cases of incident cancer occurred during follow-up, including 783 breast cancers (324 premenopausal and 459 postmenopausal), 323 prostate cancers, 182 colorectal cancers, 122 lung cancers, and 1312 obesity-related cancers.
Adults included in the cohort between May 2009 and January 2017 and who completed at least two 24-h dietary records were followed from their inclusion up to January 7, 2019 (details are shown in the flowchart in Supplementary Figure 1). Baseline characteristics of the study population were examined across sex-specific quartiles of sugar intake and were compared using ANOVA tests for continuous variables or χ 2 tests for categorical variables.
Associations between sugar intake (total and added sugars, each type of sugar and sugars from each sugary food group) and cancer risk overall, breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung (i.e., the main cancer sites in France ( ) and in the cohort), and obesityrelated cancers were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models. Since the NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort consists of delayed entries, the inclusion time is not common to all participants; therefore, age was used as time scale, which is well handled by the Cox model and avoids corelated residuals that would be generated if time was used as time scale and age modeled as a covariate. Thus, in this study, participants contributed person-time to the analyses from their age at baseline to their age at the end of their follow-up (i.e., age at cancer, death, last completed questionnaire, or January 7, 2019, whichever occurred first). Cause-specific models were computed so that death and other cancers than breast and prostate (when studying site-specific cancer risks) during follow-up were handled as competing events. HRs and 95% CIs were estimated with quartile 1 as the reference category. P for trend was obtained using the ordinal score of quartiles ( ). The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model was tested and confirmed with the rescaled Schoenfeld-type residuals method (Supplementary Figure 2). The linearity assumption was verified using restricted cubic spline functions ( ) (Supplementary Figure 3). For all covariates except physical activity, ≤5% of values were missing and imputed to the modal (categorical variables) or median (continuous variables) values. A missing class was created for physical activity (14% missing). Multiple imputation by chained equations method was also tested in sensitivity analysis ( ).
Main models were adjusted for age (time scale), BMI (in kg/m2), height, physical activity, smoking status, educational level, number of 24-h dietary records, family history of cancer, energy intake without alcohol, alcohol, sodium (Na), SFAs, ifber intake, and overall dietary patterns (“Healthy” and “Western,” derived by principal component analysis; Supplementary Method 2). Breast cancer analyses, conducted among women only, were also adjusted for the following covariates: age at menarche, age at first child, number of biological children, baseline menopausal status, and use of oral contraceptive and hormonal treatment for menopause at baseline and during followup. Coding for these covariates is indicated in footnotes to the main results table. Specific associations related to sugars from dietary sources and to each sugar type were also adjusted for the total of sugar intakes from all other sources/types than the one studied. For the premenopausal model, women contributed up to their age at menopause at the latest, and for the postmenopausal model, women contributed at the earliest from their age at menopause.
In addition, whenever an association between sugar intake and a cancer location was observed, mediation analyses were performed using the method proposed by Lange et al. ( ) to evaluate the mediation of this association by BMI (Supplementary Table 1).
A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Further adjustments for specific nutrient and/or food group intakes were tested (omega-3, vitamin D, red/processed meat, ultra-processed foods, fruit and vegetables, dairy products, and seafoods), not adjusting for Na, and SFA was also tested. Further adjustments and stratifications for recognized risk factors specific to colorectal cancer i.e., intakes of whole grains, red/processed meat, dairy products ( ) and aspirin use ( ) were tested. Other sensitivity analyses were performed based on the main model by excluding cancer cases diagnosed during the first 2 y of each participant’s follow-up to challenge reverse causality bias. Models were also tested after restriction of the population study to participants with at least four 24-h dietary records and after excluding participants with dyslipidemia at baseline and prevalent or incident cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Associations were tested in different strata of the study population. In particular, stratification by overweight status (BMI < 25/BMI ≥25) and adjustment for weight gain during followup were tested to investigate whether the observed associations were entirely driven by a weight-related pathway. The association between sugar and cancer risk was also investigated separately in younger and older participants ( < 45 y/≥45 y). Last, analyses were computed in a model with no exclusion of energy underreporters.
All tests were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis software SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute) was used for analyses.
A total of 101,279 participants (78.7% women, 21.3% men) were included in the analyses. Mean ± SD age at baseline was 42.2 ± 14.5 y. The median number of 24-h dietary records was 5. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study population by quartiles of total sugar intake. Compared with the ifrst quartile (unadjusted descriptive comparisons), participants in the highest quartile tended to be younger, more educated, and nonsmokers. They had a lower BMI, were more physically active, and were less likely to have a family history of cancer. They had lower intakes of alcohol and higher intakes of energy, SFAs, Na, and dietary fibers.
Supplementary Figure 4 shows the distribution of total and added sugar intakes in the study population, overall and by sex. Mean ± SD daily intake of sugars was 92.8 ± 33.2 g. Mean contribution of sugars to energy intake was 19.6% (19.9% in women and 18.3% in men), and free sugars contributed to 9.0% of energy intake (9.1% in women and 8.5% in men). Of note, 81.3% of participants exceeded the 5% limit of energy intake from free sugars recommended by the WHO. The relative contribution of each dietary source to sugar intake is shown in Figure 1 while Figure 2 displays the contribution of each sugar type. Sucrose accounted for 49.3% of sugar intake, followed by fructose (19.6%) and glucose (17.2%). Supplementary Figure 5 presents the contribution of the different dietary sources to the intake of each sugar type.
Associations of sugar intake with cancer risk
During follow-up (555,386 person-years, median follow-up time 5.9 y, interquartile range 2.7–8.3 y), 2503 cancer cases were diagnosed (including 323 prostate and 783 breast cancer cases, 324 premenopausal and 459 postmenopausal). Mean ± SD age at diagnosis was 58.9 ± 12.0 y. Table 2 shows the associations between total and added sugar intakes and cancer risk.
The proportional hazard assumption of the Cox models was met, as well as the linearity assumptions, as illustrated in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 for sugar intake and breast cancer risk. Sugar intake was associated with increased risk of overall cancer (HR for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.37; Ptrend = 0.02). However, this association was mainly driven by breast cancer (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.14, 2.00; Ptrend = 0.0007). Indeed, prostate cancer was not associated with sugar intake (Table 2), nor was overall cancer without breast cancer (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.25; Ptrend = 0.6, data not tabulated). Added sugar intake was associated with increased breast cancer risk (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.47; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.91; Ptrend = 0.02). The associations were stronger for premenopausal breast cancer HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.24, 3.06; Ptrend = 0.002 for total sugars and HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.41; 95% CI: 0.93, 2.14; Ptrend = 0.05 for added sugars than for postmenopausal breast cancer, for which similar but non–statistically significant trends were observed (Table 2). No association was detected for lung and obesityrelated cancers, and an inverse association was suggested for colorectal cancer and added sugar but was based on a very limited number of cases. In addition, further analyses revealed that this association became nonsignificant when models were specifically adjusted for recognized colorectal cancer risk factors (i.e., aspirin use and red meat, processed meat, whole-grain, and dairy product intakes) (Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, the association totally disappeared (P = 0.5) when analyses were conducted in participants aged ≥45 years (representing 170 out of 182 colorectal cancer cases).
When focusing on specific sugar types ( Table 3 for breast cancer, Supplementary Table 3 for other cancers), sucrose intake was associated with increased breast cancer risk (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.78; Ptrend = 0.01) while no significant association was observed for glucose, fructose, lactose, galactose, and maltose (all P > 0.1). However, sum of dairy sugars (i.e., lactose + galactose) was borderline significant (HRQ4vs.Q1 = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.58; Ptrend = 0.04, data not tabulated).
Associations between sugar intake by dietary sources and cancer risk are displayed in Table 4 for breast cancer and Supplementary Table 4 for other cancers. In particular, sugars from sugary drinks (Ptrend = 0.002), dairy products (Ptrend = 0.01), milk-based desserts (Ptrend = 0.02), dietary sources except fruit (Ptrend = 0.0007), solid food sources (excluding sugary drinks, Ptrend = 0.003), and free sugars (Ptrend = 0.01) were associated with increased breast cancer risk.
Further adjustments, analyses excluding prevalent/incident T2D, and analyses including underenergy reporters did not substantially change the results. Findings were also similar when we excluded cancer cases occurring during the first 2 y of followup, prevalent dyslipidemia, and T2D when we restricted the study population to participants with at least four 24-h dietary records and when we conducted stratified analyses, although some associations became non–statistically significant probably due to loss of statistical power in subpopulation categories (Supplementary Table 5).

not suggest a strong effect of mediation of the association by BMI (Supplementary Table 1).
In this large prospective cohort, sugar intake was associated with increased cancer risk. This association appeared to be mainly driven by breast cancer and remained significant even when weight gain during follow-up was accounted for. More specifically, added sugars, free sugars, sucrose, and sugars from sugary drinks, dairy products, and milk-based desserts were associated with increased breast cancer risk. No association was observed for other sugar sources and types.
In their latest report published in 2018, the WCRF/AICR determined that currently available data were not sufficient to establish any level of evidence regarding sugar intake and cancer risk at any site ( ). The link has been considered “limited suggestive” only between pancreatic cancer and foods and beverages containing fructose. In the present study, statistical power was not strong enough to assess this cancer site separately (43 cases diagnosed so far). Results regarding all cancer sites combined were no longer significant when breast cancers were removed from the model. Similar to our findings, previous studies did not identify significant associations between sugars and related exposures and prostate cancer risk ( ). Recently, Makarem et al. ( ) performed a systematic review and confirmed that so far, prospective evidence that addresses the association Lactose 11.15%
Maltose 2.53%
Galactose 0.23% Glucose 17.24%
Fructose 19.59% Sucrose 49.27% between dietary sugars and site-specific cancer risks was too limited to draw firm conclusions and that additional prospective data were needed. Indeed, a limited number of prospective studies investigated the association between sugar intake and breast cancer risk ( ). None of them reported significant associations. This discrepancy could be due to a limited number of cases for some studies, the use of FFQs with a lower degree of precision than repeated dietary records or recalls, or lower sugar intakes compared with our study e.g., mean consumption of 79.8 g/d in the Canadian study ( ) compared with 89.7 g/d here. In addition, 2 studies focused on postmenopausal women only ( ). In our study, no association was statistically significant in postmenopausal women, in whom sugar intake was lower compared with their nonmenopausal counterparts (85.7 compared with 91.3 g/d).
As reviewed by Makarem et al. ( ), few studies specifically investigated added sugars ( ) and suggested increased risks with leukemia ( ) and esophageal ( ), pleural ( ), and pancreatic ( ) cancers. In our study, added sugars were positively associated with breast cancer risk and inversely associated with colorectal cancer. To our knowledge, the latter association has been poorly documented. A few studies have observed consistent associations regarding dietary glycemic index/load and colorectal cancer ( ), and one found that sucrose was associated with decreased risk of proximal colon cancer among women ( ). However, our result was based on a very limited number of cases and may be due to an artifact and/or residual confounding by age. Indeed, younger participants had much higher added sugar intakes (median age in quartile 4 of added sugar intake 34.1 y compared with 47.7 y in quartile 1), and as expected, they also had a lower colorectal cancer incidence. Given the limited number of cases for this cancer site, adjustment for age in the models may not have been able to fully counteract this confounding bias, as illustrated by the nonsignificant result among older participants, despite the fact that they accounted for > 93% of the 182 colorectal cases (Supplementary Table 2).
Moreover, this is consistent with the fact that none of the analyses by sugar types were statistically significant for colorectal cancer risk.
The question of potentially differential effects of different sugar types and/or sources on cancer risk is of interest to guide public health recommendations and policies. To our knowledge, no prospective study investigated sugar intake from different dietary sources (in grams of sugar/d) in relation with breast cancer risk. However, a few cohorts studied the association between a given sugary food group or sugary drink consumption (in grams or milliliters of food or drink/d) and breast cancer risk ( ). Evidence is accumulating regarding sugary drinks and breast cancer risk ( ), consistent with our results published in 2019 from the NutriNet-Santé cohort ( ).
In contrast, only 2 studies, based on the Framingham Offspring Cohort ( ) and the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort ( ), considered sugary food groups other than drinks (e.g., chocolate and cakes, dairy desserts, grain desserts, sugary breakfast snacks) in association with breast cancer risk; no significant association was detected, but statistical power was relatively limited. In the present study, sugars from sugary drinks but also from dietary sources and, more specifically, milk-based desserts and dairy products were all associated with breast cancer risk.
Three studies based on FFQs have investigated the effects of specific sugar types on breast cancer development, and no association was detected ( ). In this study, based on a detailed dietary record with > 3500 food and beverage items and corresponding food composition table, we observed that sucrose (generally used as table sugar to sweeten coffee/teas, bake cakes/cookies, and by food industries for the preparation 1Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for age (time scale), BMI (continuous, kg/m2), height (continuous, cm), physical activity (categorical International Physical Activity Questionnaire variable: high, moderate, low, missing value), smoking status (categorical: never, former, current smokers), educational level (categorical: less than high school degree, < 2 y after high school degree, ≥2 y after high school degree), number of 24-h dietary records (continuous), family history of cancer (categorical: yes, no), energy intake without alcohol (continuous variable: kcal/d), alcohol intake (continuous, g/d), sodium (continuous, g/d), saturated fatty acids (continuous, g/d), fiber intake (continuous, g/d) and “Healthy” and “Western” dietary patter ns (continuous variables, derived by principal component analysis), age at menarche (categorical: < 12 y old, ≥12 y old), age at rfist child (categorical: no child, before 30 y, ≥30 y), number of biological children (continuous), baseline menopausal status (categorical: menopausal, nonmenopausal), oral contraceptive use at baseline and during follow-up (categorical: yes, no), and hormonal treatment for menopause at baseline and during follow-up (categorical: yes, no). In addition, all models were mutually adjusted for sugar intake from the total of all sugar types other than the one studied.
2Cutoffs for quartiles were 30.33, 42.10, and 55.92 g/d for sucrose; 10.53, 14.37, and 18.88 g/d for glucose; 11.62, 16.34, and 21.88 g/d for fructose; 5.27, 8.96, and 14.22 g/d for lactose; 0.03, 0.11, and 0.29 g/d for galactose; and 1.10, 1.69, and 2.49 g/d for maltose. of sugar-sweetened foods and beverages) was the sugar type more specifically associated with breast cancer risk, consistent with the result on added sugars. In this study, sugars from fruit were not associated with cancer risk. We cannot rule out that this could be because sugar may not be causally associated with cancer, and other nutrients/food additives co-consumed with sugar would be responsible for the association. However, another plausible explanation could be that other beneficial components in fruit offset the potential negative effects of sugar or that different types of sugars exert different effects on cancer risk, similar to the metabolic difference between fructose and glucose ( ). While positive associations were suggested in rare studies regarding fructose intake and some cancers ( ), most studies did not observe any increased risk ( ), in line with our nfidings regarding fructose or sugars from fruit. This point is important to emphasize the consistency and not the opposition of dietary recommendations promoting the consumption of enough fruit and the limitation of sugar intake. Sugars from dairy products (lactose and galactose) have been poorly studied. In the present study, they were borderline significantly associated with breast cancer risk. To our knowledge, only 3 studies ( ) investigated their effects on different cancer sites (breast, pancreas, and ovaries): no clear associations were found, except for serous invasive tumors of ovarian cancers ( ), for which an increased risk was found among higher lactose consumers from the Nurses’ Health Study. Nonetheless, these results have to be considered cautiously since a limited number of cases were available (174 among the 80,326 participants).
High consumption of sugars can lead to an excess of caloric intake, potentially inducing overweight or obesity ( ).
According to the WCRF/AICR ( ), body fatness and weight gain are, in turn, convincing risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer but probably decrease the risk of premenopausal breast cancer. Thus, a weight gain during follow-up potentially favored by sugar intake is not likely to explain the observed association between sugars and breast cancer risk, since this association was more specifically observed in premenopause. Besides, results remained significant after adjustment for weight gain during follow-up, and mediation analyses did not support a major effect of BMI in the associations. This suggests that other mechanisms could be involved. Even in the absence of weight gain, other mechanisms such as oxidative stress ( ), inaflmmation, and insulin resistance can also be fostered by sugar intake. High sugar intakes elevate postprandial glucose responses, which stimulate the production of pro-oxidant molecules e.g., peroxinitrite ( ) and induce DNA damage, which increases cancer risk.
Consistently, an association between high glycemic index and glycemic load and cancer risk has been suggested ( ). Excessive sugar intake can also generate endogenous advanced glycation end products, which are highly reactive metabolites resulting in cytokine secretion and increased markers of oxidative stress production ( ). High intakes of refined sugars also result in increased concentration of inaflmmatory markers (C-reactive protein and IL-6) ( ). In turn, inaflmmation elevates insulinlike growth factor binding protein 1 concentrations and alters gene expression, inducing cell proliferation and differentiation and favoring carcinogenesis ( ).
Strengths of this study include its prospective design and its large sample size. Moreover, regular and precise dietary assessments enabled us to accurately estimate sugar intakes and to differentiate sources and types of sugar. Even though residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out, the models were adjusted for a large range of cofactors.

First, as in all cohort studies based on the recruitment of volunteer participants, the extrapolation of the findings to the general population should be made with caution. Indeed, participants from the NutriNet-Santé cohort tended to be more health conscious, as reflected by the relatively low mean BMI (23.7 ± 4.5 kg/m2).
Therefore, this raises the question whether the findings can be generalized to heavier individuals, among whom the modest/substantial metabolic disturbances may diminish any effect sugar may have. However, main results (association between sugar intake and breast cancer risk) were similar for overweight and nonoverweight participants. The study subjects were also more likely to have healthier dietary and lifestyle behaviors, be more educated, and have higher socioeconomic and professional status than the overall French population ( ). However, compared with data from the nationally representative Third Individual and National Survey on Food Consumption (INCA 3) study ( ), mean sugar intakes were similar (95.1 g/d in the INCA 3 study compared with 92.8 g/d in NutriNetSanté). Even if the multisource approach ascertainment limited misreported or unreported cancer cases, exhaustiveness of cancer case identification cannot be guaranteed. Second, causality cannot be strongly established based on results from a single prospective observational study. However, biologic mechanisms support the plausibility of the associations found in our study ( ). In addition, further adjustments, stratification analyses, and restriction of the study population in the different tested models limited confounding bias, and explorations performed in sensitivity analyses also limited potential reverse causality.
Third, the limited number of reported cases for some site-specific cancer prevented us from studying the associations for these cancers (e.g., pancreas, liver, cancer). Last, sugar is particularly difficult to assess due to its scattered consumption pattern across foods/snacks. Although the 24-h dietary record instrument has been validated against urinary and plasma biomarkers for various key parameters of the diet (e.g., protein, sodium, vitamin C, fruit, vegetables, fish) ( ), no validation was available for sugar intake. However, strong correlation coefficients between sugar intake assessed by these web-based 24-h records and interview by a dietitian were observed: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.92) and 0.85 (0.78, 0.90) for men and women, respectively ( ). Moreover, in NutriNet-Santé, repeated and nonconsecutive 24-h dietary records were used, increasing the reliability of the measurement.
In conclusion, in this large population-based prospective cohort, higher sugar intake was associated with overall cancer and, more specifically, breast cancer risk, independently of weight gain and weight status. These findings need to be replicated in other large-scale prospective studies (notably involving more overweight/obese participants) and supported by experimental data to clarify underlying mechanisms. Nonetheless, they suggest that sugars may represent a modiafible risk factor for cancer prevention. Globally, the implementation of tax on sugary drinks and foods, as well as other sugar-related policies (e.g., the regulation of food advertising and marketing, the fixation of reference standards limiting sugar content according to product categories), is currently debated. In a context where sugar consumption is increasing in Western countries, and adding to its well-established cardiometabolic detrimental effects, these results contribute to building the evidence base suggesting that public health policies addressing sugar intake should also consider their role in cancer etiology.
